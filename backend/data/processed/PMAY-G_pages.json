It is pleasant to see the houses getting covered kitchen\nspace along with smokeless LPG Stoves through convergence with other schemes\nof Government that make their lives easier and healthier. PMAY-G is ensuring the\nupliftment of the socially deprived households by getting them a Pucca house with\nbasic amenities. Construction of a toilet has been made an integral part of the\nPMAY-G house and a house is to be treated as complete only after toilet is\nconstructed, ensures cleaner & hygienic environment. One of the unique features\ntowards women empowerment under PMAY-G that houses are sanctioned either\nsolely or jointly in name of the women also ensures a sense of security & pride\namong the woman member of the household,\n\nThe new FFI for the PMAY-G will take this noble work forward\ncontributing to better houses, greater resilience and even greater empowerment of\nWomen.

With a noble objective of eradicating\nhouseless-ness amongst the rural poor of the nation, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin\n(PMAY-G), a flagship programme of the Government is being implemented with effect from 1April\n2016. The programme is driven by the broad objective of providing “Housing for All” in rural areas\nby March 2024. It is a social welfare program through which the Government provides financial\nassistance to beneficiaries identified using SECC 2011 and Awaas+ 2018 data to help them\nconstruct a house of respectable quality for their personal living. On the requests of various\nStates/Union Territories to cover the left out beneficiaries, the Ministry conducted Awaas+ survey\nin the year 2018-2019 to identify such households who though eligible, could not find a place in the\nPermanent Wait List of PMAY-G to achieve the target of construction of 2.95 crore houses under\nPMAY-G.\n\nTo keep moving in the right direction and achieving the desired outcomes, it is necessary to\nredefine the governance structure and introduce innovations. The revised framework for\nimplementation (FFI) has been prepared with the joint effort of the Ministry and States/ UTs\nthrough a committee constituted for this purpose. | appreciate the efforts of the Rural Hosing Team\nlead by Shri Gaya Prasad, Deputy DG (RH).\n\nIn the revised framework for implementation of PMAY-G, the Ministry has tried to lay down the\nstandard procedure to deal with difficult cases viz. beneficiaries unwilling to construct the house,\ndeath of beneficiaries, permanent or temporary migration of beneficiaries, landlessness, etc.\nEfforts have also been made to introduce data visualization and analytics for performance\nmonitoring using various dashboards. The concept of Green Rural Housing for cleaner, healthier\nand energy efficient rural India has also been thought of in the revised framework.\n\nIn order to bring transparency and accountability, the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of\nFinance has brought various guidelines in respect of release of funds under Centrally Sponsored\nSchemes and monitoring of the funds released, which have also been incorporated in this revised\nversion.\n\n| hope that the guidelines will facilitate implementation of the scheme while maintaining the\nsanctity of the concept, to further strengthen our efforts towards realizing the vision of “Housing\n\nfor All” by 2024.\n\n[Nagendra Nath Sinha}\n",

  "i \n \nExecutive Summary \n1. \nPublic housing programme in the country started with the rehabilitation of \nrefugees immediately after independence and since then, it has been a major \nfocus area of the Government as an instrument of poverty alleviation. Rural \nhousing program, as an independent programme, started with Indira \nAwaasYojana (IAY) in January 1996. Although IAY addressed the housing \nneeds in the rural areas, certain gaps were identified during the concurrent \nevaluations and the Performance Audit by Comptroller and Auditor General \n(CAG) of India in 2014. These gaps, i.e. non-assessment of housing shortage, \nlack of transparency in selection of beneficiaries, low quality of house and lack \nof technical supervision, lack of convergence, loans not availed by beneficiaries \nand weak mechanism for monitoring, were limiting the impact and outcomes of \nthe programme. \n2. \nGovernment has committed to provide “Housing for All” by 2024. To fulfil \nthe Government’s commitment and address rural housing gaps, Pradhan \nMantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) is being implemented w.e.f. 1st \nApril, 2016. \n3. \nPMAY-G aims to provide pucca houses with basic amenities to all eligible houseless \nhouseholds and households living in kutcha and dilapidated house in rural areas by \n2024. To achieve the objective of “Housing for All” the target number of houses to \nbe constructed by the year 2023-24, is 2.95 Crore.  In the first phase, 1.00 crore \nhouses were taken up for construction in 3 years, i.e., 2016-17 to 2018-19. To \ncomplete the overall target of 2.95 crore houses under PMAY-G, the remaining \nhouses are to be completed by March, 2024.The minimum size of the house has \nbeen increased to 25 sq.mt. (from 20 sq.mt.) with a hygienic cooking space. The \nunit assistance has been increased from Rs. 70,000 to Rs. 1.20 lakh in plains and \nfrom Rs 75,000 to Rs.1.30 lakh in Hillstates/UTs of J&K and Ladakh, North \nEastern States, difficult areas and IAP/worst affected Left-Wing Extremism \n(LWE) districts. The beneficiary is entitled to 90/95 person days of unskilled \nlabour from MGNREGS. The assistance for construction of toilet shall be \nleveraged through convergence with SBM-G, MGNREGS or any other dedicated \nsource of funding. Convergence for piped drinking water, electricity connection, \nLPG gas connection etc. under different Government programmes is also to be \nattempted. \n4. \nThe cost of unit assistance is to be shared between Central and State \nGovernments in the ratio 60:40 in plain areas and 90:10 for 2 Hill States",
  "ii \n \n(Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and UT of Jammu and Kashmir. In \nrespect of other Union Territories, 100% cost is borne by Government of \nIndia. From the annual provision of funds for PMAY-G, 95% of funds are \nearmarked for construction of new houses. This includes 2% allocation \ntowards administrative funds for administering the scheme at the Central and \nState level.  However, any changes in the administrative funds would be \nnotified by the Ministry.For Special Projects, 5% of the total funds would be \nretained at the Central Level as reserve fund. The annual financial allocation to \nthe states is to be based on the Annual Action Plan (AAP) approved by the \nEmpowered Committee and the funds to States / UTs is to be released in two \nequal installments. \n5. \nOne of the most important features of PMAY-G is the selection of beneficiary. \nTo ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and \nthat the selection is objective and verifiable, PMAY-G, selects beneficiaries \nusing housing deprivation parameters in the Socio Economic and Caste \nCensus (SECC), 2011 data which is to be verified by the Gram Sabhas. The SECC \ndata captures specific deprivation related to housing among households. Using \nthe data households that are houseless and living in 0, 1 and 2 kutcha wall and \nkutcha roof houses can be segregated and targeted. The Permanent Wait List so \ngenerated also ensures that the states have ready list of households to be covered \nunder the scheme (through Annual Select Lists) leading to better planning of \nimplementation. To address grievances in beneficiary selection, an appellate \nprocess has also been put in place. \n6. \nIn addition, a mobile application, Awaas+, has been developed to capture \ndetails of potentially eligible households, including geo-tagged photograph of \nthe present dwelling and the proposed site for construction of PMAY-G \nhouse. The Awaas+ survey was conducted during January 2018- March 2019 \nand the details of the potential households captured using the mobile \napplication would be verified and validated and the final list of households \nprepared thereafter could be included in the Permanent Wait List. \n7. \nTo provide technical support in achieving the target of Housing for All, a \nNational Technical Support Agency (NTSA) is being set up at the national \nlevel.The activities of the Agency, inter-alia, would include ensuring quality \nconstruction,  promoting green housing, supporting the Ministry and States \nfor adoption of green construction norms, monitoring of implementation, \nmanagement of extra budgetary resources, Information Education and \nCommunication (IEC) activities, development and management of e-",
  "iii \n \nGovernance solutions, data analytics, organize trainings & workshop, and \ncoordinate / monitor / facilitate the functioning of Technical Facilitation \nCenters identified by the State / UT Governments, transition towards \ngreening on PMAY-G houses, reporting towards India’s Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals \n8. \nThe availability of skilled masons in rural areas is imperative to ensure that the \nhouses constructed under the scheme are of good quality. In this regard, the \nGovernment of India has rolled out Rural Mason Training (RMT) Program \nunder PMAY-G and set a target to train adequate number of masons by \nMarch 2024. The initiative is being assisted by the National Skill \nDevelopment Corporation (NSDC) and the data of the same is being \nmaintained on their Skill India Portal.  \n9. \nThe beneficiary to be assisted by States/UTs in house construction with a bouquet \nof house design typologies inclusive of disaster resilience features that are suitable \nto their local geo climatic conditions. These designs ensure that the beneficiary \ndoes not over-construct in the initial stages of house building which often results in \nincomplete houses or the beneficiary is forced to borrow money to complete the \nhouse. Guidance to enable construction of green houses under PMAY-G is \nalso incorporated in the provisions of the scheme. \n10. In PMAY-G, programme implementation and monitoring is to be carried out \nthrough an end to end e-Governance model - Using AwaasSoft and AwaasApp. \nWhile AwaasSoft is a work-flow enabled, web-based electronic service delivery \nplatform through which all critical functions of PMAY-G, right from \nidentification of beneficiary to providing construction linked assistance \n(through PFMS), will be carried out; AwaasApp - a mobile application is to be \nused to monitor real time, evidence based progress of house construction \nthrough date and time stamped and georeferenced photographs of the house. \nThe two IT applications help identify the slipups in achievement of targets \nduring the course of implementation of the program. All payments to \nbeneficiaries are to be through DBT to beneficiary's Bank/Post office accounts \nregistered in AwaasSoft MIS. \n11. The States have to come up with their Annual Action Plan of PMAY-G that will \ninclude a plan for convergence with other Government programs. The \nmechanism for convergence in PMAY-G is also to be strengthened through a \nsystem to system real-time transfer of information between the program that are to \nconverge with PMAY-G.",
  "iv \n \n12. A willing beneficiary is to be facilitated to avail institutional finance up to \nRs.70,000/- which would be monitored through the SLBC, DLBC and BLBC. \n13. The programme implementation is to be monitored not only electronically, but \nalso through community participation (Social Audit), Members of Parliament \n(DISHA Committee), Central and State Government officials, National Level \nMonitors etc.",

  "1 \n \nCHAPTER – 1 \nHISTORY OF RURAL HOUSING PROGRAMME IN INDIA \n1.1 \nPublic housing programme in the country started with the \nrehabilitation of refugees immediately after independence. Till the year \n1960, nearly 5 lakh families were provided houses in different parts of \nIndia.  \n1.2 \nIn 1957, as a part of the Community Development Movement \n(CDM) a Village Housing Programme (VHP) was introduced providing \nloans to individuals and cooperatives, of up to Rs.5,000/- per unit. Only \n67,000 houses could be constructed in this scheme till the end of the 5th \nFive Year Plan (1974-1979). Another scheme introduced in the 4th Five \nYear Plan (1969-1974), called the House Sites-cum-Construction \nAssistance Scheme (HSCAS), was also transferred to the State Sector \nfrom 1974-75.  \n1.3 \nSpecific focus on rural housing in India, has its origin in the wage \nemployment programmes of National Rural Employment Programme \n(NREP -1980), and Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme \n(RLEGP- 1983), by allowing construction of houses under these \nprogrammes for SCs/STs and freed bonded labourers. A full-fledged \nrural housing program Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) was later launched in \nJune, 1985 as a sub-scheme of RLEGP, with earmarking of funds, for \nthe construction of houses for SCs/STs and freed bonded labourers. \nWhen Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY) was launched in April, 1989, 6% of \nthe funds were allocated to housing for SCs/STs and freed bonded \nlabourers. In 1993-94, the coverage was extended to Non-SC/ST \nfamilies, by increasing the earmarked fund for housing under JRY to \n10%. The additional 4% was to be used for non-SC/ST category of \nbeneficiaries. \n1.4 \nIndira Awaas Yojana (IAY) was made an independent programme \nwith effect from 1st January, 1996 aimed at addressing housing needs of \nthe Below Poverty Line (BPL) households. After more than 30 years of \nits implementation, although IAY addressed the rural housing shortage",
  "2 \n \nconsiderably, however, in view of the limited scope of coverage under \nthe programme there were still considerable gaps in rural housing.  \n1.5 \nTo meet the objective ofthe Government to provide “Housing for \nAll” by 2024Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) is being \nimplemented w.e.f. 1st April, 2016. PMAY-G was launched on 20th \nNovember 2016 by Hon’ble Prime Minister from Agra, Uttar Pradesh.",
  "3 \n \nCHAPTER – 2  \nKEY FEATURES OF PMAY-G \n2.1 \nAim and Objective \n2.1.1 PMAY-G aims to provide pucca houses with basic amenities to all \neligible houseless households and households living in kutcha and \ndilapidated house in rural areas by 2024. To achieve the objective of \n“Housing for All” the target number of houses to be constructed by the \nyear 2023-24, is 2.95 Crore.  In the first phase, 1.00 crore houses were \ntaken up for construction in 3 years, i.e., 2016-17 to 2018-19. To \ncomplete the overall target of 2.95 crore houses under PMAY-G, the \nremaining houses are to be completed by March, 2024. PMAY-\nGenvisages construction of quality houses by the beneficiaries \nthemselves \nusing \nlocally \navailable \nconstruction \nmaterials, \nusingappropriate house design typologies and through trained rural \nmasons.  \n2.2 \nKey Features of PMAY-G \na.

  "5 \n \nq. To ensure quality of houses constructed, pan India training and \ncertification programmes for rural mason \nr. Bouquet of house design options with disaster resilience features \naccording to local conditions, using appropriate technology \nsuitable to their region are made available to the beneficiaries. \ns. The programme is being implemented and monitored through \nend-to-end \ne-governance \nsolutions, \nviz. \nAwaasSoft \nand \nAwaasApp, details of which are given in Chapter 13. \nt. The guidance to enable green housing has been provided in \nChapter 14.",
  "6 \n \nCHAPTER – 3 \nFinancial Arrangement and Targets \n3.1 \nSharing of the Scheme Cost \n3.1.1 To achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2024 PMAY-G \naims at construction of 2.95 crore houses. The Unit cost is Rs. 1.20 lakh \nin plain areas and Rs. 1.30 lakh in Hill States/UTs, North Eastern States, \ndifficult areas and IAPdistricts. The cost under PMAY-G is shared \nbetween Centre and the States in the ratio of 60:40. In the case of North-\nEastern Region (NER) States, two Hill States viz., Himachal Pradesh and \nUttarakhand and Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir, the sharing \npattern is in the ratio of 90:10. Centre provides 100% share in respect of \nother Union Territories (UTs). \n3.2 \nAllocation of Scheme funds \n3.2.1 The  annual provision of funds for PMAY-G, funds for \nconstruction of new houses and 2% allocation (from 1st April 2019) \ntowards administrative expenses for administering the scheme at the \nCentral and State level.  \n3.2.2 At the onset of the Financial Year, the Annual Financial \nAllocation (Program and Admin Fund) would be decided for each \nState/UT on the basis of previous year’s performances - houses pending \nfor completion & utilization of available funds, and targets allocated in \nthe current year. The Annual Financial Allocation would be part of the \nAnnual Action Plan (AAP) and would be approved by the Empowered \nCommittee chaired by Secretary (RD). \n3.3 \nAdministrative Funds   \n3.3.1 2% of the programme funds shall be available for administering \nthe scheme both at the Central and State level. Out of, this, 1.7% is \nreleased to States / UTs and 0.3% is retained at the Central Level. The \n2% earmarked for administrative funds is over and above the \nprogramme funds shared by the Government of India and State",
  "7 \n \nGovernments in the same ratio as applicable for program fund. Of the \ntotal administrative funds released to the State, up to 12.5% could be \nretained at the State/UT level and remaining 87.5% may be distributed to \nthe districts in proportion to their targets. This ratio of 1:7 of \nadministrative funds between the State and Districts can be relaxed \nwith the approval of the Ministry on submission of specific \nproposal with adequate justification by the States/UTs. The items \nof expenditure that are permitted to be incurred from the administrative \nfunds are as follows: - \ni) Activities to sensitise and impart habitat literacy and \nhousing literacy to the beneficiaries; \nii) Construction of prototypes of house typologies for \ndemonstration; \niii) Cost \nof \nsupervision \nand \nmonitoring \nof \nscheme \nimplementation including mobility, IT (hardware and \nsoftware) \nand \nCommunications \nsystems, \noffice \ncontingencies, incentives, etc.; \niv) Cost of setting up and operating PMU, including hiring of \npersonnel on contract; \nv) Cost towards training and Certification of Masons; \nvi) Training of Community Resource Persons (CRPs) viz., \nNRLM compliant SHGs, Asha workers, Anganwadi \nworkers and NGOs; \nvii) Social audit and other audits; \nviii) IEC Activities, Awards etc.; \nix) Organisation of review meetings, workshops etc.; \nx) Wall painting of PWL at the Gram panchayat/Block \nDevelopment Office.

  "8 \n \nxiii) Conduct of assessments and studies including evaluation \nstudies; \nxiv) Cost of demonstration of Innovative technologies and \nworks related to housing, \nxv) Cost of engaging IIT/NIT or other institutes of repute as \nState Technical Support Agency (STSA); \nxvi) Cost towards monitoring the quality of construction of \nPMAY-G houses; \nxvii) Cost towards promotion of green housing typologies, \ntechnologies, and materials. \n3.3.1.1 Administrative fund may be utilized towards training and \nCertification of Masons, as per the allocated target for RMT,  including \ntraining on appropriate building materials and technologies for green \nhousing. \n3.3.2 Release of Additional Rs. 45 lakh as administrative fund annually \nfrom Central Share of administrative funds (0.3% out of total \nAdministrative Fund of 2%) to each Smaller State viz. Himachal Pradesh, \nHaryana, Goa, Punjab, Uttarakhand, North Eastern States except Assam \nand Tripura and all UTs except J&K over and above the 1.70% \nadministrative funds released to the said States/UT (from FY 2021-22).  \n3.3.3 The items of expenditure that are strictly not permitted to be \nincurred under administrative expenses are as follows: - \na) Salaries/ remunerations/ honorarium of permanent government \nfunctionaries of the State Government / District / Block / GPs \nor any other implementing agency  \nb) Purchase of new vehicles and repair of old vehicles  \nc) Purchase of Land \n \n3.4 \nEarmarking of Targets",
  "9 \n \n3.4.1. Under PMAY-G, minimum 60% of the target at the national level \nis earmarked for SC/ST households. To maintain this, 60% of the target \nallocated to each State / UT is earmarked for SC/STs, subject to \navailability of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries in the Permanent Wait List \n(PWL). Within earmarked targets the proportion of SC and ST is to be \ndecided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. The \nStates/UTs, upon deciding the proportion of SC and ST in their \nState/UT, shall communicate the same to the Ministry of Rural \nDevelopment. Further, the States / UTs are allowed to interchange \ntargets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from \neither of the category and it is certified as such. In case all SC and ST \nhouseholds in the Permanent Wait List are covered, and certified by the \nChief Secretary, the State / UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries \nfrom ‘Other’ category included in the Permanent Wait List after the \napproval of the Ministry. \n3.4.2 The earmarking will only define the minimum limit that should be \nachieved and if State/UTs so desire they may add to target under these \ncategories to ensure saturation. This would be in consonance with the \ncategory wise saturation approach which requires beneficiaries belonging \nto vulnerable and disadvantaged groups to be covered on a priority basis. \n3.4.3 Once the category SC/ST in a particular State/UT has been \nexhausted, the same should be informed to the Ministry to avoid allotting \nany more targets to that particular social category in that State/UT \nduring the next year. \n3.4.4   States/UTs may follow a saturation approach keeping the Gram \nPanchayat, Block or District as a unit. Priority shall be given to SAGY \nGram Panchayats, Rurban clusters, Open Defecation Free Gram \nPanchayats, Gram Panchayat with strong social capital through DAY- \nNRLM Self Help Groups of women, Aspirational Districts and Gram \nPanchayats with Kala-azar affected Villages. Saturation approach \nimproves supervision, availability of masons and materials, and \ncomprehensive habitat planning.",
  "10 \n \n3.4.5 The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, provides for \nsocial security for persons with disabilities.  Accordingly, in the scheme \nof PMAY-G while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries \nwho are to be provided assistance, households with any persons with \ndisabilities and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded \nadditional deprivation score so that such households are given priority \nwhile allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of The Rights \nof Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, the States, to the extent possible, \nmay ensure that 5% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among \npersons with benchmark disabilities, with priority to women with \nbenchmark disabilities.  \n3.5 \nEmpowered committee \n3.5.1 There shall be an Empowered Committee chaired by the \nSecretary, Department of Rural Development, Government of India to \napprove the Annual Action Plan of the States / UTs. The Empowered \nCommittee shall consist of the of following members: - \na) Special Secretary/ Additional Secretary, Department of Rural \nDevelopment, Government of India \nb) Joint Secretary level Officer in charge of Rural Housing, \nDepartment of Rural Development, Government of India \nc) Adviser, NITI Aayog \nd) Representative of National Housing Bank \ne) Secretary dealing with Rural Housing, of the State/UT concerned \nf) Representative of Internal Finance Division. \n3.5.1.1  The Committee may co-opt any other person as required to assist \nit in its meetings \n3.5.2 The other functions of the Empowered Committee are:- \na) To approve Special Projects \nb) To approve State’s criteria for determination of “difficult areas”.",
  "11 \n \nc) To review the programme, suggest studies, measures for \npromotion of green housing etc. \nd)   Any other matters related to PMAY-G \n3.6 \nAnnual Action Plan \n3.6.1  \nThe States/UTs should prepare a comprehensive Annual \nAction Plan for implementation of PMAY-G. The Plan would, inter alia, \ninclude the roadmap for time-bound completion of the houses \nsanctioned and ensure convergence with other schemes. \n3.6.2  \nThe Annual Action Plan for the State should contain the \ndistrict-wise plan highlighting the strategy that is to be adopted for \nsaturating priority households. The district-wise plan will also, inter alia, \nhighlight mason training program, sources for construction material, \nfacilitation of loan to the beneficiary, development and dissemination \nplan for house typologies, beneficiary sensitization workshops and all the \namenities that will flow to the beneficiary through convergence with \ndifferent schemes.  \n3.6.3   At the onset of the Financial Year, the Annual Financial \nAllocation (Program and Admin Fund) would be decided for each \nState/UT on the basis of previous year performances - houses pending \nfor completion and utilization of available funds & targets allocated in \nthe current year. The Annual Financial Allocation would be part of the \nAnnual Action Plan (AAP) and would be approved by the Empowered \nCommittee. \n3.6.4 The State/UT shall upload Annual Action Plan in the prescribed \nformat on the AwaasSoft within the specific timelines prescribed by the \nMinistry for that year.",
  "12 \n \nCHAPTER-4 \nIDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION OF BENEFICIARIES  \n4.0 \nFairness and transparency in identification and selection of \nbeneficiaries is the cornerstone for realizing the goal of ‘Housing for All’. \nTo ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived, \nand that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation \nparameters in the SECC 2011 data and Awaas+ lists will be used for \nidentifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas.  \n \n4.1 \nUniverse of Eligible Beneficiaries  \n4.1.1 The universe of eligible beneficiaries under PMAY-G will include \nall the houseless and households living in zero, one or two room with \nkutcha wall and kutcha roof (kutcha houses) as per SECC data subject to \nthe exclusion process described in Annexure-I. Additional beneficiaries \nmay be drawn from Awaas+ List.  \n4.2 \nPrioritisation within the Universe \n4.2.1 There will be multi-layered prioritization within the universe of \neligible PMAY-G beneficiaries.  Priority will be first assigned on the basis \nof parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST \nand Others. To begin with, households will be prioritized based on \nhouselessness, followed by the number of rooms; zero, one and two \nrooms, in that order. In a particular social category viz., SC/ST and \nOthers, households which are houseless or living in houses with lesser \nnumber of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses \nwith greater number of rooms \n4.2.2 Within the above priority groups, households that fulfil the criteria \nof “compulsory inclusion”, as defined in SECC (criteria elaborated in \nAnnexure-I), are accorded the highest priority. For additional \nbeneficiaries drawn from Awaas+ lists, the instructions released in User \nManual [Annexure-IX(J)] and further modifications to the same will be \nused for prioritisation. Automatically included households shall not rank",
  "13 \n \nlower than other households within a priority group. Inter se priority \nwithin the two sub groups viz. households which are automatically \nincluded and otherwise, will be determined based on their cumulative \ndeprivation scores. The scores will be calculated from the socio-\neconomic parameters given below with each having equal weight.   \ni. \nHouseholds with no adult member between age 16 to 59 \nii. \nFemale headed households with no adult male member between \nage 16 to 59 \niii. \nHouseholds with no literate adult above 25 years \niv. \nHouseholds with any member with disability and no able-bodied \nadult member \nv. \nLandless Households deriving the major part of their income from \nmanual casual labour \n \n4.2.3 Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher \nwithin the sub groups.  \n4.3 \nPreparation of Priority Lists \n4.3.1 Separate priority lists, satisfying the principles of prioritization \nenunciated in para 4.2, will be generated for SC, ST and Others for each \nGram Panchayat / Village Sabha or lowest unit of local self-government \nas recognized by the respective State/UT Panchayat Act, subject to \navailability of eligible households. System generated category wise ranked \npriority list could be downloaded from the programme MIS- AwaasSoft. \nThereon, the lists are to be circulated to the concerned Gram Panchayats \nfor verification by Gram Sabha. \n4.4 \nVerification of Priority Lists by Gram Sabha (or Village \nSabha or the lowest unit of local self-government as recognized by \nthe respective State/UT Panchayat Act) \n4.4.1 Once the category wise system generated priority lists are made \navailable and suitably publicized, a Gram Sabha/Village Sabha or the \nmeeting of the lowest unit of local self-government as recognized by the \nrespective State/UT Panchayat Act, will be convened. The Gram",
  "14 \n \nSabha/Village Sabha or the lowest unit of local self-government as \nrecognized by the respective State/UT Panchayat Act, will verify the \nfacts based on which the household has been identified as eligible. If the \ninclusion has been done based on wrong facts or if the household has \nconstructed a pucca house or has been allotted a house under any \ngovernment scheme or permanently migrated since the time of the \nsurvey or has died leaving no successor, the Gram Sabha/ Village Sabha \nor the lowest unit of local self-government as recognized by the \nrespective State/UT Panchayat Act, shall delete the name of such \nhousehold from the system generated priority list. The list of deleted \nhouseholds, including reasons for deletion, will form part of the minutes \nof the Gram Sabha/Village Sabha or the lowest unit of local self-\ngovernment as recognized by the respective State/UT Panchayat Act. \n4.4.1.1 However, if a household has temporarily migrated or are not \ntraceable after preparation of the Permanent Wait List, the State/UT \nGovernment may identify the Gram Panchayats where such cases exist \nand organize the Gram Sabhas of the respective Gram Panchayats for re-\nverification in the PWL prepared. The Gram Sabha during the meeting \nmay review such cases and re-prioritize such households and place them \nat the end of the PWL, so that allotment of houses to such beneficiaries \ncan be made later. Gram Sabha resolution re-prioritizing the PWL needs \nto be uploaded on AwaasSoft and the priority in the PWL may be \nchanged accordingly. Further “beneficiaries unwilling to construct \nhouse” is also a category for deletion/remand from the PWL of PMAY-\nG as per details given in the Remand Module Guidelines detailed in para \n4.6.5. \n4.4.2 In case there is a tie with more than one household within a sub \ngroup having the same deprivation score, the Gram Sabha / Village \nSabha or the lowest unit of local self-government as recognized by the \nrespective State/UT Panchayat Act, will rank the households by \naccording priority on the basis of the following parameters: \ni) Households with widows and next-of-kin of members of \ndefence/paramilitary /police forces killed in action;",
  "15 \n \nii) Households where a member is suffering from leprosy or \ncancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV). \niii) Households with a single girl child. \niv) Beneficiary families of the Scheduled Tribes and Other \nTraditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, \n2006, commonly known as Forest Rights Act. \nv) Transgender persons. \n \n4.4.3 If none of the above parameters mentioned in para 4.4.2 are \napplicable, the Gram Sabha / Village Sabha or the lowest unit of local \nself-government as recognized by the respective State/UT Panchayat \nAct, may decide the ranking and record proper justification for the same. \nThe ranking should be complete with each household being assigned a \ndistinct rank.  \n4.5 Grievance Redressal  \n4.5.1 Post verification, once the lists have been made available by the \nGram Sabha/Village Sabha or the lowest unit of local self-government as \nrecognized by the respective State /UT Panchayat Act, the BDO or any \nofficial designated by the State / UT Government for the purpose, \nreferred to as Competent Authority hereinafter, will ensure that the lists \nare widely publicized within the Gram Panchayat for a minimum period \nof seven days. Further, he/she will be responsible for ensuring that the \nlist verified by the Gram Sabha/Village Sabha or the lowest unit of local \nself-government as recognized by the respective State/UT Panchayat \nAct, is entered on AwaasSoft after due process is completed.  \n4.5.2 After the lists have been suitably publicized for seven days, a \nwindow period of fifteen days would be provided for submission of \ncomplaints regarding deletion or change in ranking without following \ndue procedure. The complaints may be collected by any village level \nfunctionary/official appointed by the State/UT and thereafter forwarded \nto the Competent Authority for further processing or the aggrieved party \nmay submit his/her complaint directly to the Competent Authority. The \nCompetent Authority shall enquire into the complaints, prepare a report",
  "16 \n \nand submit the same in a time bound manner, the time period for which \nto be decided by the State/UT, to an Appellate Committee that is to be \nconstituted by the State. \n4.5.3 The State/UT Government shall constitute a three-member \nAppellate Committee at the District level. It may be headed by the \nDistrict Magistrate/Collector or his nominee, another official and at least \none non –official member. The term of non-official member of the \nAppellate Committee may be decided by the State Govt. The Appellate \nCommittee will consider the complaints with the report, against deletion \nor change in ranking and resolve the same within a fixed period of time. \nThe detailed procedure for hearing by the Appellate Authority, including \ntimely disposal, will be decided by the respective State/UT.  \n4.5.4 After disposal of all the cases of a Gram Panchayat, by the \nAppellate Committee, the Gram Panchayat wise final Permanent Waitlist \nfor each category with a distinct rank for each household, will be \npublished.

In case there are still some \nbeneficiaries left out, the Gram Panchayats shall help to get their \nhouse constructed. \nd) The Gram Panchayats will assist in identifying common land \navailable for allotment to the landless beneficiaries. \ne) The Gram Panchayats may facilitate beneficiaries in accessing \nmaterials required for construction at reasonable rates and help in \nidentification of trained masons.",
  "37 \n \nf) The Gram Panchayats may facilitate / encourage / motivate the \nSelf-Help Groups (SHG) to undertake production of quality \nbuilding materials for supplying the same to the beneficiaries of \nPMAY-G at reasonable rates. \ng) The Gram Panchayats would facilitate beneficiaries in availing \nbenefits of other schemes of the Centre and State Government \nthrough convergence. \nh) The Gram Panchayats should discuss the progress of the scheme \nin their scheduled meetings and help resolve the problems being \nfaced by the beneficiaries. The Gram Panchayats should also \nproactively assist the social audit teams to conduct Social Audit \ni) The Gram Panchayat may assist in identifying the local level \nfunctionary to be tagged with each PMAY-G house for ensuring \ntheir timely completion.  \n \n7.5.2 In order to enable the Panchayats to play their role effectively, the \nState/ UT Government may undertake the following: -  \na) Organise training programme to equip the Panchayats to carry \nout the tasks assigned to them.  \nb) Provide the Panchayats IEC material particularly on materials \nand building technologies.  \nc) Provide share of administrative expenses commensurate to \nwork handled.  \nd) Issue an order specifying the roles and responsibilities of each \ntier of Panchayat as appropriate to the State / UTs. In State / \nUTs having different tiers in Panchayat system, the State/UT \nGovernment may decide the responsibilities for each tier. \n \nNote: - It is clarified that in States / UTs where there are no \nPanchayats, democratic institutions at the appropriate levels \nshould be assigned the roles specified for Panchayats. In States / \nUTs where Gram Panchayats are too small, clusters of Gram \nPanchayats should be formed and enabled to perform their tasks.",
  "38 \n \n7.6 \nRole of Self-Help Groups accredited to NRLM \na) SHGs should be involved in creating awareness among the \nbeneficiaries of PMAY-G, about construction of durable \nhouses, source of procurement of materials, benefits of green \nhousing, technical know-how required for making green \nhousing, availability of skilled masons, and benefits derivable \nfrom other schemes implemented by the State / UT and \nCentral Government. \nb) The SHGs need to be involved in the construction / \ncompletion of houses sanctioned to the beneficiaries. \nc) SHG members should be trained as certified social auditors to \nundertake social audit of the PMAY-G. \nd) Production of building materials including green materials by \nthe SHGs, where feasible, should be taken up for supply of the \nsame to the beneficiaries of PMAY-G at reasonable cost, \nthereby benefitting both the SHGs and the beneficiaries.",
  "39 \n \nChapter – 8 \nCONVERGENCE \n8.1 \nTo provide basic amenities, in addition to assistance for house \nconstruction, convergence of existing schemes of both Centre and State \n/ UT Governments needs to be ensured. Various schemes that need to \nbe converged for providing basic amenities include: - \na) Construction of a toilet has been made an integral part of the \nPMAY-G house. The toilet shall be provided to beneficiaries \nthrough funding from Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin (SBM-\nG), MGNREGA or any other dedicated financing source. The \nhouse shall be treated as complete only after the toilet has been \nconstructed. \nb) It is mandatory to provide support of 90 persondays (95 \npersondays in Hill states, difficult areas and North Eastern States \nand IAP districts) unskilled wage employment at the current \nrates to a PMAY-G beneficiary for construction of his / her \nhouse in convergence with MGNREGA as per instructions \nissued from time to time. Server to server integration between \ntwo MIS – AwaasSoft of PMAY-G and NREGASoft of \nMGNREGS has been developed so that work for construction \nof house is generated on NREGASoft automatically once the \nsanction of house is issued on AwaasSoft.  \nc) Drinking water is one of the basic necessities of life. The \nbeneficiary of PMAY-G should be provided access to safe \ndrinking water in convergence with Jal Jeevan Mission and Har \nGhar Nal Se Jal (HGNSJ) of Department of Drinking Water and \nSanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti or any other similar schemes. \nd) PMAY-G beneficiary shouldbe provided electricity connection \nthrough convergence with relevant scheme implemented by \nMinistry of Power /State Government/UT Administration.  \ne) States / UTs should strive to ensure that the beneficiaries of the \nPMAY-G get benefits of the schemes implemented by Ministry \nof New and Renewable Energy Sources (MNRES) including for",
  "40 \n \nSolar Lanterns, Solar Home Lighting Systems, Solar Street-\nlighting Systems, the benefits from National Bio-Mass \nCookstoves Programme (NBCP) for cleaner cooking energy \nsolutions for the beneficiary family and bio gas unit under \nNational Biogas and Manure Management Programme. \nf) To provide clean and more efficient cooking fuel to the \nbeneficiaries of PMAY-G, the States / UTs should strive to get \nLPG connections for them under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala \nYojana (PMUY) of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas or \nany other relevant Scheme. \ng) In order to ensure a cleaner and healthy environment for the \nhouseholds, the solid and liquid waste generated by the \nhouseholds needs to be treated. Accordingly, the State / UT \nGovernment may, through convergence with Swachh Bharat \nMission (G) or any other scheme of the State / UT \nGovernment, ensure management of Solid and Liquid Waste. \nh) To meet the requirement of building materials, the State / UT \nmay take up production of building materials viz., bricks, \nstabilized mud blocks, fly ash bricks etc., through convergence \nwith MGNREGA. Further, SHGs may also be encouraged for \nthe production of building materials, etc. The material produced \nmay be supplied to the beneficiaries of PMAY-G. Efforts should \nalso be made towards promotion of green building materials and \ntechnologies. \ni) States / UTs may, through convergence with MGNREGA, \ndevelop group / individual amenities like development of house \nsites, bio-fencing, paved pathways, approach roads or steps to \nthe house, soil conservation and protection works etc., for the \nbeneficiaries of PMAY-G \n \n8.2 \nThe schemes / programmes mentioned above for convergence are \nillustrative and not exhaustive. The State/ UT Government may take the \ninitiative to converge PMAY-G with other schemes of the Centre and \nStates/UTs so that the benefit of those schemes is provided to the",
  "41 \n \nbeneficiaries of PMAY-G. The States / UTs may also explore the \npossibility of utilizing funds available under Corporate Social \nResponsibility (CSR) initiatives for the welfare of beneficiaries. \n \n8.3 \nTo ensure convergence at the ground level, State and District \nLevel Committees (para 7.4 of Chapter 7) in their meetings should \ninclude convergence as an agenda point with periodical monitoring and \nreview. The Committees would also advise inclusion of various schemes \netc. for convergence in Annual Action Plan. The district level plan as in \npara 3.6.2 to be reviewed by the Committees during their meetings. \n8.4      Since the SECC 2011 data base & finalised Awaas+ lists, as \nvalidated by the Gram Sabha, are the basis for selection of beneficiaries \nin PMAY-G and the SECC 2011 data base is being used by many other \nprogrammes, convergence of benefits will become much easier if \nregularly followed up along with other common information captured \nacross various programmes.",
  "42 \n \nCHAPTER – 9 \nREPORTING AND MONITORING  \n \n9.0 \nA robust monitoring mechanism has been adopted to monitor \nperformance as well as the processes under PMAY-G. Performance \nmonitoring is done through real time capture of progress using workflow \nenabled transactional data in AwaasSoft. The data generated from the \ntransactions in AwaasSoft are collated as system generated reports for \nmonitoring different parameters of performance. Further, Ministry of \nRural Development has developed Performance Index Dashboard to \nmonitor the performance of the States / UTs, Districts, Blocks and \nPanchayats on different pre-determined parameters and nationally rank \nthe States, Districts and Blocks accordingly. This has been done to \nfacilitate continuous monitoring of progress, both on the selected \nparameters and also geographically, while ensuring healthy competition \namong the states. Additionally, for process monitoring mechanisms like \ninspection by central teams (Area Officers and NLM), monitoring by \nDistrict \nDevelopment \nCoordination \nand \nMonitoring \n(DISHA) \nCommittee headed by Member of Parliament, Social Audit, Internal \nAudit and through State Level PMU are adopted. \n \n9.1 \nReporting \n9.1.1 AwaasSoft generates many reports on different parameters based \non the real time transactional data. All reporting under PMAY-G shall be \nthrough reports generated in AwaasSoft. The progress of the States/UTs \nunder the scheme shall be monitored only through the reports generated \nfrom AwaasSoft.  \n \n9.2 \nPerformance: \n \n9.2.1 The parameters used for monitoring the performance of a \nState/UT shall be as follows: -",

All new beneficiary accounts should be opened in \nBanks/Post Offices withCore Banking Solutions (CBS). \nd. Release of 1st instalment to the beneficiary within 7 days after \nsanction. \ne. Completion of 1st inspection within 2 months of sanction. \nf. Completion of targets within the stipulated time (as mentioned in \npara 5.6.2) from the data of sanction of the house. \n \n9.3 \nMONITORING \nMonitoring under PMAY-G is conceived to be multi-level and \nmulti – agency with profuse use of technology. Monitoring shall be done \nat the level of Government of India, State/UT Governments with \nemphasis on quality and timely completion of house and adoption of \ngreen materials and technologies as far as possible. \n9.3.1 Monitoring by Government of India \n9.3.1.1 \nMonitoring at the level of Government of India is done \nthrough IT enabled e-governance platform including Dedicated Micro \nMonitoring Dashboard, Performance Index Dashboard, as well as \nthrough ground verifications by different agencies like Area Officers, \nNational Level Monitors and DISHA.  The end-to-end execution of the \nscheme from the selection of beneficiaries, disbursal of assistance to \nbeneficiaries, verification of progress in construction, release of funds",
  "44 \n \netc. is conducted through workflow enabled transaction-based MIS – \nAwaasSoft. \n \n9.3.1.2 \nThe physical progress of stage-wise construction on ground \nis verified and monitored through geo-referenced, date and time stamped \nphotographs captured by inspectors or by beneficiaries using the mobile \nbased application - “AwaasApp” and uploaded on AwaasSoft. The \nquality of houses constructed under PMAY-G will be monitored through \na quality monitoring module developed in the mobile application \n“AwaasApp”. \n9.3.1.3 \nNational Level Monitors and Area Officers of the Ministry \nshall also visit PMAY-G houses to assess the progress and processes \nfollowed under the scheme during their field visits. The DISHA \nCommittee at the district level, headed by an Hon’ble Member of \nParliament, will also monitor progress and implementation of PMAY-G. \n9.3.1.4 \nThe National Technical Support Agency at the National \nlevel would act as the nodal agency for coordinating and monitoring of \ndifferent aspects of implementation of PMAY-G including green \nhousing. \n9.3.2 Monitoring by State/UT Governments \nThe Programme Management Unit (PMU) in the States/UTs, as \nmentioned in Chapter 7 shall also monitor the scheme implementation \nand quality supervision at different levels including Green Housing. It is \nsuggested that -  \na) Officers at the Block level should inspect as far as possible 10% of \nthe houses during construction.  \nb) District level officers should inspect 2% of the houses during \nconstruction. \nc) Every house sanctioned under PMAY-G to be tagged to a village \nlevel functionary including Government employees (Gram Rozgar",

In such a scenario, the interest \naccrued on State advances over and above the matching State share shall \nbe clearly accounted by States / UTs. However, the rules pertaining to \noperation of SNA will be applicable. \nf)  The States / UTs are free to supplement the unit assistance under \nPMAY-G through their own resources. They can do so either through \nSNA or through separate account. In case they choose the SNA to \nsupplement, the choice shall be communicated to the Ministry to make \nnecessary adjustments in AwaasSoft. In such scenario, rules pertaining to \noperation of SNA will be applicable.

  "76 \n \nCHAPTER 14 \nGREENING PMAY-G \n \n14.1 The Vision \nGreening of PMAY-G aims at contributing towards a cleaner and \nhealthier India. PMAY-G encourages adoption of, as far as possible, \ngreen designs and technologies, appropriate to the local culture and geo-\nclimatic conditions (including multi-hazards), use of local material \nminimising carbon foot print and that the houses are comfortable. It also \naims at adding to local job creation,. It is envisaged that the green \nPMAY-G designs and technologies will influence rural housing in general \nand enable rural India to emerge with sustainable housing with green and \ndisaster resilient features in the future. The states may take steps to \nencourage willing beneficiaries to adopt green technologies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 14.1: Green Housing in PMAY-G",
  "77 \n \n14.2 What is a green building \nA ‘green building’ reduces or eliminates negative impacts and can create \npositive impacts on the climate and natural environment in its design, \nconstruction and operation. Green buildings preserve precious natural \nresources and improve the quality of life of the people. Below are some \nof the benefits of green buildings – \na) \nEnvironmental benefits: Green building is resource-efficient \nthroughout its lifecycle from siting, design, construction, occupancy, \nmaintenance, renovation, and demolition. It optimizes the use of natural \nresources, energy, water, and materials. It promotes renewable energy \nsuch as solar energy, reduces pollution and waste, enables re-use and \nrecycling of the resources. \nb) \nEconomic benefits: In green buildings, the operational cost on \nlighting, ventilation, cooling / heating etc. are reduced significantly. \nc) \nImproves occupants’ productivity: Green Buildings also support \nhealthier, happier, and more productive lives of the occupants. \n \n14.3 Objectives of Green housing under PMAY-G \nThe objective of green housing is to ensure high quality, sustainable rural \nhouses with low adverse environmental impact which are also \ncomfortable, healthy, safe, and affordable  \n \n14.4 How to choose Green Materials & Technologies   \n14.4.1 Greenness can be achieved by using appropriate materials and \ntechnologies to reduce CO2 emission and depletion of non-renewable \nresources. Figure 14.1 (extreme right box) shows the different ways of \nachieving greenness in housing. \n14.4.2 Local materials are inherently green and in addition, they have less \nnegative environmental impact due to less or no need for transportation. \nGreenness could also be achieved by using alternative materials like",
  "78 \n \ncompressed stabilized earth block, renewable material such as bamboo, \netc.  \n14.4.3 Alternative technologies can be used to achieve greenness by \nreducing consumption of high emission and energy-intensive materials. \nFor example, if one uses 230 mm thick rat trap bonded brick wall instead \nof 230mm thick solid brick wall; about 20% bricks and 25% cement \ncould be saved with an added advantage of increased indoor thermal \ncomfort and enhanced employment opportunity.  \n14.4.4 For any particular region there will be only a few appropriate \ngreen materials and technologies and it will not be difficult to identify \nand implement the same through trained local construction workers of \nthe region. The States may refer to PAHAL, which provides information \non a number of multi-hazard-safe green materials and technologies \nidentified for different parts of India. PAHAL can be accesed with the \nfollowing links:  \nhttps://rhreporting.nic.in/netiay/Document/Pahal.pdf \nhttps://rhreporting.nic.in/netiay/Document/Pahal-Volume-II.pdf \n \n14.5 Incentives and Promotion of Green Housing  \n14.5.1 To encourage adoption of green design and technology in PMAY-\nG, States/UTs may decide upon their own incentive structure.  \n14.5.2 To create an enabling environment for adopting green \ntechnologies in PMAY-G, states may consider construction of \ndemonstration houses using green materials and green technologies.",

Need for Awaas+ Survey\n\nPradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana — Gramin (PMAY-G) was launched with an\nobjective of construction of 2.95 crore houses in the rural areas by March 2022.\nThe scheme is being implemented in 2 phases -Phase-I (2016-17 to 2018-19)\nand Phase-II (2019-20 to 2021-22). The selection of beneficiaries under\nPMAY-G has been done based on the housing deprivation parameters included\nin the Socio-Economic Caste Census - 2011, followed by validation by the\nGram Sabha.\n\nAlthough the Permanent Wait List of (PWL) was prepared after following the\nprescribed procedure, still many States/UTs had reported exclusion errors\nimplying that certain households though eligible, could not find place in the\nPWL of PMAY-G, owing to various reasons. Therefore, an exercise to identify\nsuch households was initiated through the States / UTs using Mobile\nApplication “Awaas+”. Data from around3.57 crore households have been\n\ncaptured during this exercise.\n\nTarget Allocation from System\n\n2.1. Introduction\n\nIn order to explore the algorithms to conduct Awaas+ data analysis, an Expert\nCommittee consisting of stakeholders from Ministry of Statistics and Programme\nImplementation (MoSPI), National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), National\nInformatics Centre (NIC), Centre for Data Analytics (CEDA), MoRD and other\n\nPage 4 of 16\n\n129\n",
  "agencies was constituted, under the Chairpersonship of Dr. Nagesh Singh, Former\nAdditional Secretary (MoRD).\n\nTarget allocation at GP level as per recommendation from this committee was\ndone using proportion of MGNREGA person-days generated. However, several\nstates raised their concerns regarding usage of MGNREGA man-days as the sole\nindicator for target distribution. The man-days generated may also reflect the\nadministrative efficiency and work demand in a GP and alone is not sufficient for\ntarget allocation GP wise. Therefore, a new Expert Committee under the\nChairmanship of Shri Pravin Srivastava, Former Secretary, Ministry of Statistics\n\nand Programme implementationwas formed with below key objectives:\n\n(i) To examine the proposals of the State Governments for de-linking of\nMGNREGA persons for allocation of Awaas+ Targets\n(ii) Allocation of targets up to GP\n\n(iii) Priority list generation\n2.2. Methodology for Target Allocation GP wise\n\nZ Scores of the parameters - MGNREGA person-days in last three years,\npercentage of SC/ST population and SECC deprivation score are calculated.\nCumulative Z Scores of these parameters is then calculated. This is then multiplied\nin the proportion of eligible Awaas+ registrations to the total rural households in\nthat GP. Awaas+ state allocations are divided in this ratio comprising of Z score\nand proportion of Awaas+ registrations. Target allocated at various levels can be\n\nviewed in the reports.\n\n1.

System will also take care of cases where PWL ina\nparticular category is less than the target calculated, in such cases target will\n\nreduced to PWL available in that category.\n\n2a. Methodology for Target Re-Shuffle\n\nIt is to be noted that the States/UTs will remand the ineligible beneficiaries. After\nremand of ineligible beneficiaries, there may be a scenario wherein the available\nbeneficiaries’ category wise may be less than the target allocated. Moreover, there\nmay also be cases wherein beneficiaries’ category wise may be more than the\ntarget allocated. Therefore, the surplus/deficit target will be re-distributed amongst\nthe GPs. The surplus target will be available in the state pool. It is to be noted that\n\nthe target in the state pool will be maintained category wise.\n\nPage 7 of 16\n\n",
  "A button will be there at state level to re-shuffle the targets available in state pool.\nThe process of allocation of target in state pool is same as that for Target allocation\nGP wise as per Shri Pravin Srivastava Committee. First time target re-shuffle\nbutton will be available to distribute target deficiency due to rounding off done to\n\narrive at whole number for target allocation.\n\nPriority List Generation\n\n3.1. Pre-prioritization/Eligibility Criteria\n\nBefore generating the priority list, pre-prioritization exercise is done to find list of\neligible beneficiaries. In this exclusion and inclusion criteria is applied as per\nSECC 2011. Further, de-duplication is done from AwaasSoft using Aadhaar\n\nnumber.\n\nA. Exclusion Criteria as per SECC 2011\n\nStep 1: Exclusion of pucca houses- All households living in houses with pucca\nroof and/or pucca wall and households living in houses with more than 2 rooms are\n\nfiltered out.\n\nStep 2: Automatic Exclusion— From the remaining set of households, all\nhouseholds fulfilling any one of the 13 parameters listed below are\nautomatically excluded: -\n\n1. Motorized two/three/four-wheeler/ fishing boat\n2. Mechanized three/ four-wheeler agricultural equipment\n\n3. Kisan Credit Card with credit limit of Rs.50,000 or above\n\nPage 8 of 16\n\n133\n",

  "3.2. Prioritization Methodology\nAs per the recommendations of Shri Nagesh Singh Committee, Awaas+ priority\nlist is generated using combination of three parameters. Three parameters namely\nfamily size, maximum age in family and mandays worked under MGNREGA are\nused for assigning priority to the beneficiaries. In case Z Scores have same value,\nsame rank is given to such cases and a tie breaker mechanism as mentioned in Step\n5 will be used for assigning unique ranks.\n\nSteps followed for prioritization are as given below:\n\nStep 1. Z Scores are calculated for parameters - family size, maximum age in\nfamily and mandays worked under MGNREGA\n\nZ value = (Xi-Mean)/SD\n\nWhere Xi denotes the individual value of a parameter. Mean denotes the sum of all\nvalues under the selected parameter divided by the number of values. SD denotes\nStandard Deviation.\n\nStep 2. Total Z Score is calculated by adding Z Scores of these parameters\n\nStep 3. The Z Score obtained in Step 2 is translated in a rank to assign priority to\neach beneficiary. Separate priority lists will be generated for SC, ST, Others and\nMinorities for each Gram Panchayat / Village Sabha or lowest unit of local self-\ngovernment.\n\nPriority list generated as per Shri Nagesh Singh Committee is taken as the base.\nFurther, prioritization is based on methodology mentioned in FFI.\n\nStep 4. Prioritization in each category SC/ST, Minorities and Others is done on\nhouselessness. Households with zero, one and two rooms are arranged in this order\nsuch that HH zero rooms are given higher priority.\n\nStep 5. Deprivation score is used as a tiebreaker for resolving ties across the ranks\nwhich have the same rank till Step 4.\n\nDeprivation Scores with equal weightage to below parameters\n\n¢ Households with no adult member between age 16 to 59\n\ne Female headed households with no adult male member between age 16 to 59\n¢ Households with no literate adult above 25 years\n\n¢ Households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member\n\nPage 10 of 16\n\n135\n",

Priority List Finalization - Steps to be followed\n\n1. The first step is to remove ineligible beneficiaries from Awaas+ list.
