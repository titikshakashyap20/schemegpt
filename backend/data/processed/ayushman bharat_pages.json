An equally important mandate of the Health and Wellness Centre is\nto ensure an increased focus on health prevention and promotion, so that good health\nand wellness becomes a Jan Andolan and ushers in collective responsibility and care.\nThese Centres should become facilitators and platform for all wellness activities\nincluding yoga in the community.\n\nThe Health and Wellness Centres are expected to harness the potential and benefits\nof technology for improved service delivery, capacity building and reporting in the\nhealthcare sector. The effective delivery of universal Comprehensive Primary Health\nCare will directly and positively impact the other pillar of Ayushman Bharat through\nthe decongestion of secondary care facilities and reduction of healthcare costs.\n\nThe journey to strengthen the Health and Wellness Centres is a learning process,\nbuilding on a shared vision of universal coverage and access. | expect that these\nguidelines will evolve as we go forward, building on state and district experiences, so\nthat the Health and Wellness Centres herald significant improvements in health\noutcomes.\n\n(Jagat Prakash Nadda)\n\n348, U-epu, Prafor aaa, ag feeet-110 011\n348, A-Wing, Nirman Bhawan, New Delhi-110 011\nTele. : (O) : +91-11-23061661, 23063513, Telefax : 23062358, 23061648\nE-mall : hfwminister@gov.in .",

  "MESSAGE\nThe launch of these Operational Guidelines for Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health\nand Wellness Centres marks a major milestone in the history of public health in India. They are based\non the premise of an effective health systems, acknowledging the changing disease burden and it also\nincludes interventions that account for high proportions of morbidity and mortality leveraging a slew of\nprogrammes launched in the past few years to reduce out of pocket expenditures.\nThe operational guidelines are comprehensive and draw on the lessons of the National Health Mission\nin various contexts. They are ambitious in their scope and scale and include guidance on physical and\nfinancial requirements, service packages, IT requirements, monitorable targets and also suggest reforms\nin payment packages including team-based incentives.\nThe delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health Care is not without challenges, since it involves a paradigm\nshift at all levels of the health system. The NHM has paved the way for effective implementation of HWC,\nand states must leverage this learning for effective implementation of HWC.\nThe guidelines, albeit very comprehensive, are a road-map, and states will need to adapt these to their\ncontexts. However, I do hope that states will use the guidelines to develop a state specific road map, and\nbuild shared accountability at district and sub district level, so that there is a clear goal and focus to help\nus reach the target of operationalizing 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres.\nThe Operational Guidelines are based on inputs from states which have been valuable in strengthening\nthese guidelines. I would also like to thank the team at the National Health Systems Resource Centre,\nexperts and state government officials whose relentless efforts have made the launch of these guidelines\npossible.\nManoj jhalani Manohar agnani rajani r.

  "1\nSE C T I O N\niNTROdUCTiON\nThe National Health Mission (NHM), the country’s flagship health systems strengthening programme,\nparticularly for primary and secondary health care envisages “attainment of universal access to equitable,\naffordable and quality health care which is accountable and responsive to the needs of people”. Investments\nduring the life of the NHM in its earlier phases were targeted to strengthen Reproductive and Child Health\n(RCH) services and contain the increasing burden of communicable diseases such as Tuberculosis, HIV/\nAIDS and vector borne diseases. While such a focus on selective primary health care interventions, enabled\nimprovements in key indicators related to RCH and select communicable diseases, the range of services\ndelivered at the primary care level did not consider increasing disease burden and rising costs of care on\naccount of chronic diseases.\nStudies show that 11.5% households in rural areas and about only 4% in urban areas, reported seeking any\nform of OPD care - at or below the CHC level (except for childbirth) primary care facilities, indicating low\nutilization of the public health systems for other common ailments1. National Sample Survey estimates for\nthe period-2004 to 2014 show a 10% increase in households facing catastrophic healthcare expenditures.\nThis could be attributed to the fact that private sector remains the major provider of health services in\nthe country and caters to over 75% and 62% of outpatient and in-patient care respectively. India is also\nwitnessing an epidemiological and demographic transition, where non-communicable diseases such as\ncardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, respiratory, and other chronic diseases, account for over 60% of\ntotal mortality.2\nThere is global evidence that Primary Health Care is critical to improving health outcomes. It has an important\nrole in the primary and secondary prevention of several disease conditions, including non-communicable\ndiseases. The provision of Comprehensive Primary Health Care reduces morbidity and mortality at much\nlower costs and significantly reduces the need for secondary and tertiary care. For primary health care to be\ncomprehensive, it needs to span preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative aspects of care.\nPrimary Health Care goes beyond first contact care, and is expected to mediate a two-way referral support\nto higher-level facilities (from first level care provider through specialist care and back) and ensure follow up\nsupport for individual and population health interventions.\nIn India, the need for and emphasis on strengthening Primary Health Care was firstly articulated in the Bhore\nCommittee Report 1946 and subsequently in the First and Second National Health Policy statements (1983\n1 Key Indicators of Social Consumption in India on Health, National Sample Survey 71st Round, 2014, Ministry of Statistics and Programme\nImplementation, Government of India\n2 WHO. Non Communicable Diseases; Country Profile for India; 2014\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "2\nand 2002). India is also a signatory to the Alma Ata declaration for Health for All in 1978. The Twelfth Five\nYear Plan Identified Universal Health Coverage as a key goal and based on the recommendations of the\nHigh- Level Expert Group Report on UHC had called for 70% budgetary allocation to Primary Health Care in\npursuit of UHC for India.\nThe National Health Policy, 2017 recommended strengthening the delivery of Primary Health Care, through\nestablishment of “Health and Wellness Centres” as the platform to deliver Comprehensive Primary Health\nCare and called for a commitment of two thirds of the health budget to primary health care.\nIn February 2018, the Government of India announced that 1,50,000 Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs)\nwould be created by transforming existing Sub Health Centres and Primary Health Centres to deliver\nComprehensive Primary Health Care and declared this as one of the two components of Ayushman Bharat.\nThis was the first step in the conversion of policy articulations to a budgetary commitment.\nThe Report of the Primary Health Care Task Force, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of\nIndia while reiterating that primary health care is the only affordable and effective path for India to Universal\nHealth Coverage, also provided valuable insights into structure and processes that are required in health\nsystems to enable Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC).\nThe delivery of CPHC through HWCs rests substantially on the institutional mechanisms, governance\nstructures, and systems created under the National Health Mission (NHM). NHM, as part of health system\nreform in the country, in its nearly 12 years of implementation, has supported states to create several\nplatforms for delivery of community-based health systems, expanding Human Resources for Health and\ninfrastructure towards strengthening primary and secondary care. Though largely limited to a few conditions,\nNHM created mechanisms for expanded coverage and reach, and developed systems for improved delivery\nof medicines, diagnostics and improved reporting. About five years ago, these components were also\nintroduced in urban areas.\nThus, although the delivery of universal Comprehensive Primary Health Care, through HWCs builds on\nexisting systems, it will need change management and systems design at various levels, to realise its full\npotential. The other component of Ayushman Bharat, namely the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY)\naims to provide financial protection for secondary and tertiary care to about 40% of India’s households.\nIts success and affordability rests substantially on the effectiveness of provision of Comprehensive Primary\nHealth Care through HWCs. Together, the two components of Ayushman Bharat will enable the realization\nof the aspiration for Universal Health Coverage.\n1.1. About the Guidelines\nThese guidelines were developed after consultation with policy makers and practitioners at national and\nstate level and with technical experts. It also draws on implementation experiences of government, NGO and\nprivate sector in the delivery of Primary Health Care. These guidelines are intended to serve as a framework\nfor operationalizing the multiple components required for the delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health\nCare services through the Health & Wellness Centres. These guidelines are expected to support programme\nmanagers at state and district levels in rolling out Comprehensive Primary Health Care. They provide an\noverview of the systems requirements and strategies for change management to deliver CPHC.\nThe use of these guidelines would enable the states to put in place the necessary design elements and sub-\nsystems required for Health and Wellness Centres to be created and deliver the health services expected of\nthem. However, states have the flexibility to make necessary modifications based on their specific needs and\ncapacities. The implementation of Comprehensive Primary Health Care would require substantial change\nmanagement in processes for planning, service delivery, monitoring and financing and will require the\nactive participation of several stakeholders including civil society, NGOs, academic and research agencies,\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "3\ndevelopment partners, the private sector and, most importantly, the community. Operationalizing HWCs will\nbe incremental in nature with contextual variations in models and processes evolving in different states.\nThese guidelines do not cover grounds included in several other guidelines already issued but highlight\nareas in which transformation and change management is needed, besides clarifying key concepts related\nto Comprehensive Primary Health Care and Health and Wellness Centres.\nThese guidelines are envisaged to be reviewed periodically and revised based on implementation\nlessons from the field so that they continue to provide meaningful and updated guidance to programme\nimplementers and inform policy adaptation and modification.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",

  "2\nSE C T I O N\ndefiNiNG HeALTH ANd\nWeLLNeSS CeNTReS\nIn order to ensure delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) services, existing Sub Health\nCentres covering a population of 3000-5000 would be converted to Health and Wellness Centres (HWC),\nwith the principle being “time to care” to be no more than 30 minutes. Primary Health Centres in rural and\nurban areas would also be converted to HWCs. Such care could also be provided/ complemented through\nBox 2.1. Key Principles\n1. Transform existing Sub Health Centres and Primary Health Centres to Health and Wellness Centers to ensure\nuniversal access to an expanded range of Comprehensive Primary Health Care services.\n2. Ensure a people centered, holistic, equity sensitive response to people’s health needs through a process of\npopulation empanelment, regular home and community interactions and people’s participation.\n3. Enable delivery of high quality care that spans health risks and disease conditions through a commensurate\nexpansion in availability of medicines & diagnostics, use of standard treatment and referral protocols and\nadvanced technologies including IT systems.\n4. Instil the culture of a team-based approach to delivery of quality health care encompassing: preventive,\npromotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative care.\n5. Ensure continuity of care with a two way referral system and follow up support.\n6. Emphasize health promotion (including through school education and individual centric awareness) and\npromote public health action through active engagement and capacity building of community platforms and\nindividual volunteers.\n7. Implement appropriate mechanisms for flexible financing, including performance-based incentives and\nresponsive resource allocations.\n8. Enable the integration of Yoga and AYUSH as appropriate to people’s needs.\n9. Facilitate the use of appropriate technology for improving access to health care advice and treatment initiation,\nenable reporting and recording, eventually progressing to electronic records for individuals and families.\n10. Institutionalize participation of civil society for social accountability.\n11. Partner with not for profit agencies and private sector for gap filling in a range of primary health care functions.\n12. Facilitate systematic learning and sharing to enable feedback, and improvements and identify innovations for\nscale up.\n13. Develop strong measurement systems to build accountability for improved performance on measures that\nmatter to people.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "6\noutreach services, Mobile Medical Units, health camps, home visits and community-based interaction,\nbut the principle should be a seamless continuum of care that ensures the principles of equity, quality,\nuniversality and no financial hardship.\nThe HWC at the sub health centre level would be equipped and staffed by an appropriately trained Primary\nHealth Care team, comprising of Multi-Purpose Workers (male and female) & ASHAs and led by a Mid-Level Health\nProvider (MLHP). Together they will deliver an expanded range of services. In some states, sub health centres have\nearlier been upgraded to Additional PHCs. Such Additional PHCs will also be transformed to HWCs.\nA Primary Health Centre (PHC) that is linked to a cluster of HWCs would serve as the first point of referral for\nmany disease conditions for the HWCs in its jurisdiction. In addition, it would also be strengthened as a HWC\nto deliver the expanded range of primary care services.\nThe Medical Officer at the PHC would be responsible for ensuring that CPHC services are delivered through\nall HWCs in her/his area and through the PHC itself. The number and qualifications of staff at the PHC would\ncontinue as defined in the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).\nFor PHCs to be strengthened to HWCs, support for training of PHC staff (Medical Officers, Staff Nurses,\nPharmacist, and Lab Technicians), and provision of equipment for “Wellness Room”, the necessary IT\ninfrastructure and the resources required for upgrading laboratory and diagnostic support to complement\nthe expanded ranges of services would be provided. States could choose to modify staffing at HWC and\nPHC, based on local needs.\nThe HWC would deliver an expanded range of services (Box 2.2). These services would be delivered at both\nSHCs and in the PHCs, which are transformed as HWCs. The level of complexity of care of services delivered\nat the PHC would be higher than at the sub health centre level and this would be indicated in the care\npathways and standard treatment guidelines that will be issued periodically.\nBox 2.2: Expanded Range of Services\n1. Care in pregnancy and child-birth.\n2. Neonatal and infant health care services.\n3. Childhood and adolescent health care services.\n4. Family planning, Contraceptive services and other Reproductive Health Care services.\n5. Management of Communicable diseases including National Health Programmes.\n6. Management of Common Communicable Diseases and Outpatient care for acute simple illnesses and minor\nailments.\n7. Screening, Prevention, Control and Management of Non-Communicable diseases.\n8. Care for Common Ophthalmic and ENT problems.\n9. Basic Oral health care.\n10. Elderly and Palliative health care services.\n11. Emergency Medical Services.\n12. Screening and Basic management of Mental health ailments.\nIn many states, the Primary Health Centre would serve as the first point of referral and administrative hub\nfor sub health centres. However, in certain states, the sub health centre is linked directly to the Community\nHealth Centre (CHC) at the block level (which in some blocks is a role performed by the Block PHC). Across\nall contexts however, it must be ensured that administrative, technical/mentoring and referral support be\nprovided by a MBBS Medical Officer in a facility that is in geographic proximity to the cluster of HWCs and is\nequipped to manage referral support for HWC. This could therefore be either a PHC or a CHC.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "7\nSimilarly, in the urban context, the Urban Primary Health Centres or Urban Health Posts, where they exist,\nwould be strengthened as HWCs to deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care. The norm of One MPW-\n(F) per 10,000 population supported by four to five ASHAs, will enable outreach services, preventive and\npromotive care and home and community-based services. Therefore, in the urban context, the team of MPWs\n(F) and ASHAs would be considered equivalent to a front-line provider team with the first point of referral\nbeing the UPHC catering to about at 50,000 population. All the key principles of HWCs indicated above will be\napplicable to PHCs in urban areas. Initial action for upgrading UPHCs to HWCs would require capacity building\nof staff and field functionaries in the expanded range of services. Population enumeration, empanelment,\ndisease screening would also be required. In many cities, where specialists’ consultation is currently being\nmade available through evening OPDs on pre-fixed days, these could be leveraged as a strategy for ensuring\ncontinuity of care. However, states are free to undertake modifications that best fit their contexts.\nIn planning for HWCs, states need to pay close attention to improving geographic accessibility, ensure the\nfull complement of staff at each level, enable regular capacity building and supportive supervision, ensure\nuninterrupted supply of medicines and diagnostics, and maintain a continuum of care seamlessly linking\npeople to various levels of care so that the services offered at the primary health care level fully meet the\npromise of expanded range and commensurate outcomes.\nFigure 2.1: Key Elements of HWC\nAs the principle of HWC is that they provide a continuum of care for all illnesses in the community, strategic\nmodifications of components of health systems at secondary and tertiary levels and re-organization of\nworkflow processes would be needed in parallel to effectively implement Comprehensive Primary Health\nCare through HWCs.\nClear demarcation of services that are provided in the Community, HWC and PHC/CHC levels is difficult.\nServices provided at the primary health care level, are in fact, a shifting goal post, affected by a range of factors.\nHowever, this initiative under Ayushman Bharat, proposes to use diagnostic and technological innovation to\nbring services as close to people and communities as possible. We need to recognize that poor service delivery\nat HWC will, adversely impact the gate-keeping role and push patients unnecessarily into costlier secondary\nand tertiary care facilities. It could also result in pushing patients to the private sector with adverse implications\nfor out of pocket expenditure and impoverishment. Figure 2.1 illustrates the key elements of HWC.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "8\n2.2. Inputs for Health Wellness Centres\nThe key inputs to be provided at a HWC are listed below:\n2.2.1 Primary health care team to deliver the expanded range of services.\na. at the upgraded ShC – A team of at least three service providers (one Mid-level provider, at least\ntwo (preferably three) Multi-Purpose Workers – two female and one male, and team of ASHAs at the\nnorm of one per 1000.\nb. at the strengthened PhC – PHC team as per IPHS standards. Although all the PHCs have been\nexpected to provide 24*7 nursing care, this has not been possible in several states for variety of\nreasons. In 24*7 PHCs having inpatient care, an additional nurse should be posted where cervical\ncancer screening is being undertaken/ planned. In PHCs that are not envisaged to provide inpatient\ncare, the existing nurses should receive modular training in certificate course for primary care.\nIn urban areas, the team would consist of the MPW- F (for 10,000 population) and the ASHAs\n(one per 2500).\n2.2.2 logistics – Adequate availability of essential medicines and diagnostics to support the expanded\nrange of services, to resolve more and refer less at the local levels, and to enable dispensation of\nmedicines for chronic illnesses as close to communities as possible.\n2.2.3 infrastructure – Sufficient space for outpatient care, for dispensing medicines, diagnostic services,\nadequate spaces for display of communication material of health messages, including audio visual\naids and appropriate community spaces for wellness activities, including the practice of Yoga and\nphysical exercises.\n2.2.4 digitization – HWC team to be equipped with tablets/smart Phones to serve a range of functions\nsuch as: population enumeration and empanelment, record delivery of services, enable quality follow\nup, facilitate referral/continuity of care and create an updated individual, family and population health\nprofile, and generate reports required for monitoring at higher levels.\n2.2.5 Use of Telemedicine/iT Platforms – At all levels, teleconsultation would be used to improve referral\nadvice, seek clarifications, and undertake virtual training including case management support by\nspecialists.\n2.2.6 Capacity Building – Mid Level Health Providers will be trained in a set of primary healthcare and\npublic health competencies through an accredited training programme that combines theory and\npracticum with on the job training. Other service providers at HWC will also be trained appropriately\nto deliver the expanded range of services.\n2.2.7 health Promotion – Development of health promotion material and facilitation of health promotive\nbehaviours through engagement of community level collectives such as – Village Health Sanitation\nand Nutrition Committee (VHSNCs), Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS) and Self-Help Groups (SHGs), and\ncreating health ambassadors in schools. Enabling behaviour change communication to address life\nstyle related risk factors and undertaking collective action for reducing risk exposure, improved care\nseeking and effective utilization of primary health care services.\n2.2.8 Community Mobilization – for action on social and environmental determinants, would require\nintersectoral convergence and build on the accountability initiatives under NHM so that there is no\ndenial of health care and universality and equity are respected.\n2.2.9 linkages with Mobile Medical Units – Linkages with Mobile Medical Units (MMU) could serve to\nimprove access and coverage in remote and underserved areas where there is difficulty in establishing\nHWCs. In such cases, medicines and other support could be provided to frontline workers, with\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "9\nperiodic MMU visits. MMUs could also be linked to nearby HWCs, where medical consultation could\nbe arranged on scheduled days, for those unable to travel to referral sites. MMUs could be used in\nconjunction with specific service delivery platforms, which otherwise are difficult to operationalize in\nthat locality. MMUs can be designed to meet the specific needs in that locality, as a supplement to the\nHWC network. The visit calendar of the MMUs would need to be planned and displayed at HWC.\n2.3. Financing\nSuitable payment mechanism for primary health care will need to be explored. Once the systems for\npopulation empanelment and record of services are streamlined, the possibility of financing on a per capita\nbasis can be explored. In addition, team based incentives would be initiated. This will be done to facilitate\naccountability to outputs/outcomes and provide individual centred care.\n2.4. Essential Outputs of HWC\n2.4.1 The hWC data Base: Population enumeration and empanelment implies the creation and\nmaintenance of database of all families and individuals in an area served by a HWC. This is planned\nsuch that every individual is empanelled to a HWC. This also involves active communication to make\nresidents aware of this facility.\n2.4.2 health Cards and Family health Folders: These are made for all service users to ensure access to all\nhealth care entitlements and enable continuum of care. The health cards are given to the families and\nindividuals. The family health folders are kept at the HWC or nearby PHC in paper and/or digital format.\nThis ensures that every family knows their entitlement to healthcare through both HWC and the\nPradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana or equivalent health schemes of state and central government.\n2.4.3 increased access to Services: HWCs would provide access to an expanded range of services\nindicated in Box 2.2. The availability of services would evolve in different states gradually, depending\non three factors- the availability of suitably skilled human resources at the HWC, the capacity at\ndistrict/sub-district level to support the HWC in the delivery of that service, and the ability of the\nstate to ensure uninterrupted supply of medicines and diagnostics at the level of HWC. States will\nalso have the flexibility to expand the range of service to address local health problems as defined\nby disease prevalence.\n2.5. Outcomes\n2.5.1 improved population coverage: Active empanelment and HWC database will improve the population\ncoverage. The HWC database would enable HWC staff to monitor and identify the left out population\nand improve coverage of national health programmes.\n2.5.2 reduced out of pocket expenditure and catastrophic health expenditure: Improved access to\nexpanded services closer to the community, assured availability of medicines and diagnostic services\nand linkages for care coordination with Medical Officers/specialists across levels of care will reduce\nfinancial hardships faced by community.\n2.5.3 risk factor mitigation: Health promotion efforts by primary health care team would support in\naddressing the risk factors for diseases.\n2.5.4 decongestion of secondary and tertiary health facilities: A strong network of HWCs at the sub\ndistrict level would facilitate resolving more cases at primary level and reduce overcrowding at\nsecondary and tertiary facilities for follow up cases as well as serve a gate keeping function to higher-\nlevel facilities.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "10\n2.6. Impact\n2.6.1 improved population health outcomes: Improved availability, access and utilization will in turn\ncontribute to equitable health outcomes measured through periodic population based surveys for\nkey indicators listed in Section 10.1- Monitoring.\n2.6.2 increased responsiveness: Provision of care by primary care team will be based on principles of\nfamily led care including dignity and respect for individuals and communities with particular focus on\nmarginalized, information sharing, encouraging participation, including intersectoral collaboration\nthat will lead to increased trust building, comfort in access to care and enable addressing social and\nenvironmental determinants.\nWhile not all inputs can be provided immediately, the state needs to have a road map for HWC strengthening,\nin which some inputs can be added in an incremental manner. However, addition of the services for chronic\nconditions with requisite HR who is trained, and with the medicines and diagnostics would be a critical first\nstep. The centres which do not fulfil all criteria but have only initiated expanded service delivery, would be\nreferred to as “HWCs – progressive,” and have a clear time line to become “fully functional HWC”- i.e., with\nthe entire complement of the primary health care team, and delivery of the expanded range of services,\nidentified for Comprehensive Primary Health Care.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "3\nSE C T I O N\nSeRviCe deLiveRY ANd\nCONTiNUUM Of CARe\n3.1. Expanded Service Delivery\n3.1.1 Population Enumeration and Empanelment of Families at HWC\nThe Primary Health Care team at the HWC would serve as the fulcrum of Comprehensive Primary Health\nCare and support system, for planning, delivery and monitoring services for the defined catchment\npopulation. Once the HWCs have been decided, population enumeration to facilitate empanelment is a\ncritical first step.\nIn order to ensure equitable population coverage and to address issues of marginalization, the frontline\nworkers would create population-based household lists and undertake registration of all individuals and\nfamilies residing within the catchment area of a Health and Wellness Centre. It is this registration that is\nreferred to as empanelment. It is a right of anyone, resident in that area to be enrolled. Care should not be\ndenied to those who are not enrolled but seek care at the HWC. An active process of enrolment is encouraged\nto ensure that there is an active contact between the HWC team and the entitled population.\nEmpanelment of all individuals to a particular HWC serves several roles. It lays the foundation for trust\nbetween the community and the primary health care team. It declares the HWC as the first port of call for\nhealth for the community that the government is providing. It makes the HWC responsible for the health\nof population, and it enables a facilitatory role for access to secondary and tertiary care through its referral\nmechanisms and linkages. Finally it also provides follow up support as per the treatment plan provided\nby the higher facility. Empanelment of individuals and families would also facilitate monitoring universal\ncoverage for all programmes viz. Maternal and Child Health, Family Planning, Immunization and chronic\ndisease screening, long term communicable diseases. It also enables a basis for payment by capitation at a\nlater stage, which would be most useful for HWCs catering to larger than expected populations.\nThis is however likely to be a challenge in urban and other areas where population density is high. Population\nempanelment, updated at shorter periodic intervals would clarify the geographic and population coverage.\nThe HWC is responsible for undertaking this, so as to make explicit the population under its care. This makes\nit possible for the team to understand the specific needs of population sub-groups, local specific needs, and\nenable monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the team including assessment of quality of care\nand coverage. Families can choose to be empanelled with one of the many HWCs in urban areas.\nFamily Health Folders and an individual health records will be created through the ASHAs and the MPWs and\nstored in the HWC. A digital format of the family health records will be implemented in a phased manner\ndepending on the state of readiness for connectivity and resource availability. Population Based Records/\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "12\nData Base already available should be leveraged to initiate HWC based digital records of demographic\ninformation of individuals.\n3. 1.2. Organization of Services\nDelivery of an expanded range of services, closer to the community at HWCs would require re-organization\nof the existing workflow processes. The delivery of services would be at three levels i.e., i) Family/Household\nand community levels, ii) Health and Wellness Centres and iii) and Referral Facilities/Sites. Delivery of services\ncloser to the community and close monitoring would enable increased coverage and help in addressing\nissues of marginalization and exclusion of specific population groups.\nFigure 3.1: Organization of Service Delivery\nFamily/HouseHold and HealtH and Wellness\nFirst reFerral level\nCommunity level Centres\nFamily/household and Community level health and Wellness Centres First referral level – Referral\n– The ASHA and MPW will undertake house – The HWC must be kept open care and sites will vary with\nvisits supported and supplemented by with services available for each illness, its care pathways\nthe MPWs for community mobilization for at least six hours in the day. and availability of specialists.\nimproved care seeking, risk assessments, Outreach services and home For consultations on acute\nscreening, follow up for primary and visits of the team members illness, it is the MO in the PHC\nsecondary prevention, counselling and should be so scheduled that or the specialist in CHC/DH,\nincreasing supportive environment in someone is available at the either physically or through\nfamilies and community.

Service Delivery Framework\nThe services envisaged at the HWC level will include early identification, basic management, counselling,\nensuring treatment adherence, follow up care, ensuing continuity of care by appropriate referrals, optimal\nhome and community follow up, and health promotion and prevention for the expanded range of services.\nThe primary health care team led by the Mid-level health provider would be trained to provide first level of\nmanagement and triage i.e. refer the patient to the appropriate health facility for treatment and follow up.\nCare provision at every level would be provided as per clinical pathways and standard treatment guidelines.\nThis would facilitate the decongestion of the secondary and tertiary care facilities as the primary care\nservices would be made available at the HWC level closer to the community with adequate referral linkages\nand early identification and management will prevent disease progression that would require secondary/\ntertiary care interventions. Thus, the HWC team would play the critical role of coordination by assisting\npeople in navigation of the health system and mobilizing the support for timely access to specialist services\nwhen required.\nThe HWC would also play an important role in undertaking public health functions in the community\nleveraging the frontline workers and community platforms.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "13\nThe chapter on service delivery outlines the range of services that would be made available at the community\nlevel, at the HWC and at the referral sites to ensure effective delivery of primary care services. Task Forces are\nconcurrently working on finalizing detailed care pathways for some of the services. These will be circulated to\nstates as and when they are finalized. For services related to RCH, Communicable Diseases and five common\nNon-Communicable Diseases such care, pathways and Standard Treatment Guidelines are already available.\nHowever, these may require to be updated from time to time.\n3.1.4. Continuity of Care and Patient Centric Care\nContinuity of care is one of the key tenets of Primary Health Care. Continuum of care spans for the individuals\nfrom the same facility to her/his home and community, and across levels of care- primary, secondary and\ntertiary. Care must be ensured from the level of the family through the facility level.\nzz Community/household: The ASHA would undertake home visits to ensure that the patient is taking\nactions for risk factor modification, provides counselling and support, including reminders for follow\nup appointments at HWC and collection of medicines.\nzz hWC: Dispensation of medicines, repeat diagnostics as required, identification of complications\nand facilitating referrals at a higher-level facility/teleconsultation with a specialist as required are\nundertaken at the HWC, including maintenance of records. The last activity would enable HWC\nteam to identify stable patients, and to organize community level supportive activities to improve\nadherence to care protocols and reduction of exposure to risk factors.\nz The referring HWC uses a clear referral format to provide information on reason for referral and\ncare already being provided and other details as necessary (especially on insurance coverage). The\nreferring HWC also ensures that the appropriate specialists are available in that facility and to the\nextent possible, facilitate the referral appointment.\nzz higher-level Facility: The referred medical officer or specialists would examine the patient and\ndevelop/modify the treatment plan, including instructions for the patient as well as a note to the\nHWC provider, indicating the need for change. Systems need to be in place so that a medicine\nprescribed by a specialist is made available to the patient at the HWC where she/he is empanelled.\nPeriodic meetings (whether in person or through virtual platforms) between HWC team and the\nspecialists/ medical officers referred to, are also essential to ensure that they all function as one team\nand ensure care continuum.\ndeveloping referral linkages: In effect, every existing HWC providing the expanded range of services, would\nmanage the largest proportion of disease conditions and organize referral for consultation and follow up with\nan MBBS doctor at the linked Primary Health Centre- HWC, (one per 30,000 population/20000 in hilly areas)\nthat would also provide a similar set of services as the sub centre HWC, but of a higher order of complexity.\nThe Block PHCs and CHCs would now need to provide referral services beyond emergency obstetric care, to\ninclude general medical and specialist consultation. Strengthening of health facilities as FRUs and first level of\nhospitalization would need to be done in a phased manner based on the availability of infrastructure, equip-\nment and Human Resources for Health at the identified health facilities. For example, cases of acute simple ill-\nness need not be referred to DH/FRU but can be handled at PHC itself. On the other hand, high-risk pregnancy,\nsick new born, care for serious mental health ailments may be referred directly to a District Hospital.\nEmpanelment of population in HWC will facilitate gate keeping, as it will help families in identifying their\nclosest health facility. Patient centric care, trust building by primary care team, adopting standard treatment\nprotocols, and assured supply of medicines would facilitate in resolving more cases at the HWC level and\nreduce direct seeking of care at secondary level facilities.\nensuring two-way referrals between various facility levels: The delivery of Comprehensive Primary\nHealth Care particularly for chronic conditions requires periodic specialist referral. Treatment for chronic\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "14\nconditions can be preferably initiated by MO at PHC, in consultation with concerned specialist at secondary/\ntertiary care facilities. An IT system/teleconsultation can considerably facilitate this process. The loop\nbetween the primary care medical provider and the specialist must be closed. This can be achieved when\nthe specialists at district facility or higher are able to communicate to the medical officer of the adequacy\nof treatment, any change in treatment plans, and further referral action.\nUsing Mobile Medical Units to increase access: In order to expand access to services, and reach remote\npopulations, MMUs would enable an expansion of service delivery and serve the role of enabling the\nprovision of Comprehensive Primary Health Care and serving to establish continuum of care.\nTable 3.1- Service Delivery Framework*\nHealth Care Care at Community Level Care at the Health and Wellness Care at the Referral Site**\nServices Centre- Sub Health Centers\nCare in zzEarly diagnosis of pregnancy zzEarly registration of pregnancy zzAntenatal and postnatal care\npregnancy and and issuing of ID number and of high-risk cases\nzzEnsuring four antenatal care\nchild birth Mother and Child protection\nchecks zzBlood grouping and Rh typing\ncard\nand blood cross matching\nzzCounselling regarding care\nzzAntenatal check-up including\nduring pregnancy including zzLinkage with nearest ICTC/\nscreening of Hypertension,\ninformation about nutritional PPTCT centre for voluntary\nDiabetes, Anaemia,\nrequirements testing for HIV and PPTCT\nImmunization for pregnant\nservices\nzzIdentifying high risk woman-TT, IFA and Calcium\npregnancies and follow up supplementation zzNormal vaginal delivery and\nAssisted vaginal delivery\nzzEnabling access to Take home zzScreening, referral and follow\nration from Anganwadi centre. up care in cases of Gestational zzSurgical interventions like\nzzFollow up to ensure Diabetes, and Syphilis during Caesarean section\ncompliance with IFA in normal pregnancy zzManagement of all\nand anaemic cases zzNormal vaginal delivery in complications including\nzzFacilitating institutional specified delivery sites as per ante-partum and post-partum\ndelivery and supporting birth state context - where Mid-level haemorrhage, eclampsia,\nplanning provider or MPW (F) is trained puerperal sepsis, obstructed\nas Skill Birth Attendant (Type labour, retained placenta,\nzzPost- partum care visits B SHC) shock, severe anaemia, breast\nzzIdentifying complications abscess.\nzzProvide first aid treatment\nrelated to child birth, post- and referral for obstetric zzBlood transfusion facilities\npartum complications and\nemergencies, e.g. eclampsia,\nfacilitating timely referrals\nPPH, Sepsis, and prompt\nreferral (Type B SHC)\nneonatal and zzHome based new-born care zzIdentification and zzCare for low birth weight\ninfant health through 7 visits in case of management of high risk newborns (<1800gms)\nhome delivery and 6 visits in newborn - low birth weight/\nzzTreatment of asphyxia and\ncase of institutional delivery preterm/ sick newborn\nneonatal sepsis\nand sepsis (with referral as\nzzIdentification and care of\nrequired) zzTreatment of severe ARI and\nhigh risk newborn - low birth\nDiarrhoea / dehydration cases\nweight/preterm newborn and zzManagement of birth asphyxia\nsick newborn (with referral as (Type B SHC) zzVitamin K for premature babies\nrequired) zzIdentification, appropriate zzChildhood and Adolescent\nzzCounselling and support referral and follow up of health care services including\nfor early breast feeding, congenital anomalies immunization Management\ncomplimentary feeding of all emergency and\nzzManagement of ARI/Diarrhoea\npractices complication cases\nand other common illness and\nzzIron Supplementation referral of severe cases\nzzAdoption of Safe and hygiene zzScreening, referral and\nWASH practices follow up for disabilities and\ndevelopmental delays\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",

  "4\nSE C T I O N\nHUMAN ReSOURCeS\n4.1. Mid Level Health Provider\nA key addition to the primary health team at the SHC-HWC, would be the Mid-level Health Provider\n(MLHP) who would be a Community Health Officer (CHO) - a BSc. in Community Health or a Nurse\n(GNM or B.SC) or an Ayurveda practitioner, trained and certified through IGNOU/other State Public\nHealth/Medical Universities for a set of competencies in delivering public health and primary health\ncare services.\nThe rationale for introducing this new cadre of health provider is to:\nzz Augment the capacity of the Health and Wellness Centre to offer expanded range of services closer\nto community, thus improving access and coverage with a commensurate reduction in OOPE.\nzz Improve clinical management, care coordination and ensure continuity of care through regular\nfollow up, dispensing of medicines, early identification of complications, and undertaking basic\ndiagnostic tests.\nzz Improve public health activities related to preventive and promotive health and the measurement\nof health outcomes for the population served by the HWC.\nThis will improve utilization of health services at primary care level, reduce fragmentation of care, and work\nload at secondary and tertiary care facilities. Districts will be encouraged to find MLHPs from within their\ndistrict. However, since not all districts may have adequate availability of eligible candidates, it may be\nappropriate to plan MLHPs as a State cadre that will adhere to state specific cadre management rules. The\nstate should make cadre rules and communicate to districts. States could also explore the possibility of\ncreating a district cadre.\n4.1.1 Selection of Mid Level Health Providers for the Health and Wellness Centres\nIt is important to ensure the following processes for selection of the MLHPs are followed so that candidates\nwith the right attitude, competencies and motivation to work in rural and remote settings are recruited.\nStates should especially undertake local selection to maximize retention.\nzz Widely published notification that are clear on eligibility norms, job deliverables, selection criteria,\nremuneration pattern, date of written test and interview.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "22\nzz Transparent short listing of applications.\nzz Conduct of written assessment and interviews of the shortlisted candidates to assess competency\nof the candidates and willingness to serve in rural remote areas respectively.\nzz Finalization of the score sheet and submission of the list of selected candidates to State Health\nMission for ratification.\nzz Appointment to posts based on a system of “counselling” where those higher on the final merit list\nget to choose first from the posts that are vacant. The district will however retain the right to transfer\nthem, usually within the district or state, if a need to do so arises.\nRecruitment of Mid- Level Health Providers can be undertaken through a state level advertisement that\nclearly indicates district wise positions and preference for selection of local candidates. States are free to\nselect in-service candidates or candidates from the open market. If desirable, states can reserve a proportion\nof seats for women candidates. The recruitment process of Mid-Level Health Providers will be state specific\nbut for ensuring transparency and quality in selection, each state will need to supervise and assist every\ndistrict for initial screening of applicants based on the qualifications, followed by a written examination\nthat the state conducts; with support from any suitable government organization/institutions/public/health\nuniversity with expertise in conducting such exams for large scale quality selection of candidates. This should\nbe followed by interviews to select the most competent candidates.\n4.1.2 Roles\nThe Mid- Level Health Provider would broadly be expected to carry out public health functions,\nambulatory care, management and provide leadership at the HWCs. They would be responsible for the\nfollowing:\n1. Ensure that all households in the service areas are listed, empanelled and a database is maintained-\nin digital format/ paper format as required by the state.\n2. Provide clinical care as specified in the care pathways and standard treatment guidelines for the\nrange of services expected of the HWC.\n3. Clinical care provision would include coordinating for care/ case management for chronic\nillnesses based on the diagnosis and treatment plan made by the Medical Officer/specialists\nwho will initiate treatment for chronic diseases, dispense drugs as per standing orders by the\nmedical officer.\n4. Such coordination could be facilitated through processes such as telehealth. However, MLHPs can\nalso provide medicines as per the provisions of Schedule K, Item 23.\n5. Focus attention in screening for chronic conditions on screening, enabling suspected cases\nconfirmed and initiating treatment based on appropriate STGs or on basis of plans made by\nmedical officer/specialists. As a team, ensure adherence, along with counselling and support as\nneeded for primary and secondary prevention efforts. Such chronic conditions would include\nboth non-communicable diseases and the chronic communicable diseases of tuberculosis,\nleprosy and HIV.\n6. Coordinate and lead local response to diseases outbreaks, emergencies and disaster situations and\nsupport the medical team or joint investigation teams for disease outbreaks.\n7. Support the team of MPWs and ASHAs on their tasks, including on the job mentoring, support and\nsupervision and undertaking the monitoring, management, reporting and administrative functions\nof the HWC such as inventory management, upkeep and maintenance, and management of untied\nfunds.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "23\n8. Support and supervise the collection of population based data by frontline workers, collate and\nanalyse data for planning and report the data to the next level in an accurate and timely fashion. Use\nHWC and population data to understand key causes of mortality, morbidity in the community and\nwork with the team to develop a local action plan with measurable targets, including a particular\nfocus on vulnerable communities.\n9. Coordinate with community platforms such as the VHSNC/MAS/SHGs and work closely with PRI/\nULB, to address social determinants of health and promote behaviour change for improved health\noutcomes.\n10. Address issues of social and environmental determinants of health with extension workers of\nother departments related to gender based violence, education, safe potable water, sanitation,\nsafe collection of refuse, proper disposal of waste water, indoor air pollution, and on specific\nenvironmental hazards such as fluorosis, silicosis, arsenic contamination, etc.\n11. Guide and be actively engaged in community health promotion including behaviour change\ncommunication.\n4.1.3 Training and Mentorship\nThe Mid Level Health providers would be trained in either Certificate Programme in Community Health,\nmanaged and certified by IGNOU/ state universities or have a B.Sc. degree in Community Health.\nThe curriculum will enable the MLHP to attain a set of competencies related to public health and primary\nhealth care. In order to accommodate the needs of rapid scale up, states would be encouraged to partner\nwith public /medical universities to also deliver the Certificate Programme. In addition, a modular course,\nwhile retaining the core competences would also be explored, combining theoretical and experiential\ncomponents, and to enable the candidates to use a learning by doing approach.\nTo improve training quality states shall also institutionalize District Level Committee of Observers to\nmonitor the ongoing trainings. These committees can have representation from-Service providers of NGO\nrun hospitals/Nurse Training Colleges/Faculty of MPW Training Centres/Medical Colleges and Counsellors\nfrom programme study centres and may submit feedback to State NHM/District Health Officers/CMHOs on\nimprovement areas if any.\nIn addition, states will need to create a strong mentorship programme including through programmes like\nECHO (Extension for Community Health Care Outcomes) for supporting the MLHPs through handholding,\ntrouble shooting, problem solving, to enable building of technical competencies and sustaining motivation.\nThe mentors could be drawn from schools of public health/medical colleges/district health teams/Technical\nsupport agencies and development partners.\n4.1.4 Career Progression\nAs the programme matures, and for MLHP to see an aspirational future trajectory, avenues for career\nprogression of Mid-Level Health Provider would be explored in public health functions up to block, and\ndistrict level, in synergy with the public health cadre. The figure below shows a proposed career progression\nplan for the mid-level health providers.\nWhile planning the career progression at block and district level, states have the flexibility to engage MLHPs\nin different areas as appropriate. Further, as means to ensure retention, preference or reservation of seats for\nMLHPs may be planned in other job opportunities at state/district level and in continuing Medical Education-\nMSc, PG-DPHM courses etc.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",

MPW (M & F) would need skills to\nfunction as paramedics for undertaking laboratory, pharmacy and counselling functions. Similarly, at\nthe HWC-PHC level, staff would be appropriately skilled to function as ophthalmic technicians, dental\nhygienists, physiotherapists, etc. Staff that opt to provide such services would be trained and equipped\nwith specific skills, and be provided with additional compensation. The use of technology would be\nharnessed to undertake the training/multi-skilling given the sheer magnitude of the task. Platforms\nsuch as ECHO, Massive Open Online Courses, SatCom, etc. would be used. States will need to enter into\npartnerships with a range of academic and training organizations to help deliver such multi-skilling on\nan ongoing basis.

Authentication\nof service users is also possible at the time of service delivery – by using biometric, OTP, or backend analytics of\nphotograph, if required.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",

Road Map and Planning for HWCs\nSeveral states are now moving forward with the implementation of Health and Wellness Centres. Overall,\nthe designing, upgrading and establishment of HWCs should be such that states are able to achieve an\nequitable distribution of health care with an efficient utilization of resources. Steps for states to follow while\nplanning HWCs are discussed below. The State, District and Sub district planning would vary based on local\ncontext and states should adopt the guidelines to suit their needs.\n6.1.1 Developing a Road Map\nzz The first step for each state is to develop a short to medium term road map with number of Health\nand Wellness Centres that will be created over a five-year period and also develop robust and\nobjective annual plans with specific targets for the state and district level to improve access to the\nCPHC facilities, keeping in mind local context and capacity.\nzz The plan should define target of the number of facilities (PHCs/Urban PHCs/ Sub Health Centres)\nthat can be upgraded to effectively deliver expanded range of services on a year on year basis.\n6.1.2 Phasing and Identification of Districts\nzz States should plan for a phase wise scale-up indicating districts that will be included in each phase.\nzz Conforming to the overall principles of equity, selection of those districts should be prioritized\nin the initial phase, which align with the ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ Programme of\nGovernment of India. The programme for Universal Screening Prevention and Management of\nCommon Non- Communicable Diseases has been rolled out in all the states and has been prioritized\nin districts where the National Programme for Control of Cancer, Diabetes and Cardiovascular\nDiseases has been well implemented. An overlap of Health and Wellness Centres with districts\nselected for Universal Screening of NCDs should be planned to leverage pre-existing investment in\nhealth systems to deliver care for NCDs.\n6.1.3 Selection of Blocks\nzz Once the plan and phasing across the districts is clear, states should select the blocks, which would\nbe taken up for creating HWCs. Within a district, the programme may be commenced in good\nperforming blocks with human resources and better referral support. While doing so, simultaneous\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "34\nattention will be required to identify and address HR/infrastructure gaps in other blocks to gradually\ninclude them in HWCs development plan for future phases.\nzz The plan should be to take up all SHCs and PHCs within any chosen block for upgradation into\nHWCs. In certain contexts, block saturation will be a challenge owing to constraints in availability of\nhuman resources, infrastructure, and geographic inaccessibility. In such cases, in the first year, state\nmay plan to operationalize HWCs in 60-70% Sub Health Centres in the selected block and undertake\nnecessary measures to strengthen HR and infrastructure in remaining Sub Health Centres so as to\nmake them functional by next year. Within a block, such PHCs that are relatively well performing\nwith MBBS MO should be prioritized for transforming as HWC. SHCs which are linked to these PHCs\ncan be upgraded to HWCs to maintain continuum of care.\nzz The block level plan should identify facilities, which can serve as referral centre or for the cluster of HWCs.\nThe referral center may vary for different services depending on the nearest site where the necessary\nskills are available. Thus, the MO in the PHC would be adequate for initiating treatment for chronic\ncommunicable diseases but for attending to a patient with a serious mental illness/NCD, consultation\nwith concerned specialists at the nearest facility would be needed. However, the bulk of such referral\nneeds are likely to be attended at the Sub-Divisional Hospital, a FRU- CHC or a Block PHC.\nzz Sub Health Centres for upgrading as Health and Wellness Centres should be prioritized:\na. Where a community of about 3000- 5,000 populations is not within the reach of a PHC/ Block-\nPHC /CHC or a Sub-Divisional Hospital within 30 minutes.\nb. Where population coverage of Sub Health Centres could be lower but access available to serving\npopulation is constrained due to geographic access or otherwise and travel time to reach the\nSub-Centre from the most remote place in the coverage area is more than half an hour.\nc. Where progress of health indicators is significantly lower than the block/district average due to\nsocial and cultural barriers of access such as the case of tribal hamlets, villages with high density\nof marginalized and vulnerable population groups etc.\nzz The Sub Health Centres situated within a distance of 1-2 km from the referral centres could be\nupgraded as Health and Wellness Centre at a late stage if required.\nzz However, population covered by these centres should be linked with the designated referral centre\nand population empanelment, health risk profiling and other outreach activities for CPHC services\nwill continue to be provided by the team of Multi-Purpose Workers and ASHAs.\n6.2 Infrastructure for Health and Wellness Centres\nzz Ensuring adequate infrastructure for the delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health Care and Health\nand Wellness Centres would need to cater to a population size as per IPHS norms for Sub Health\nCenters- one per 5000 population in all areas and one per 3000 in tribal, hilly and desert areas. Where\ncurrently sub-centers are catering to much larger population, their numbers need to be increased.\nzz Planning for infrastructure upgrade succeeds the finalization of number and type of facilities\ndesignated as Health and Wellness Centres. Most states have completed the development of\ninfrastructure for PHCs/Additional PHCs, UPHC but there will be a need to undertake minor civil\nrepair and infrastructure upgrade for existing buildings for meeting necessary gaps in enabling\nthese centres to deliver patient friendly services.\nzz Patient reception and registration centers, citizen charters, electronic display boards for services,\nprovision of sitting arrangement of patients, other amenities in the waiting area, TV screens for health\ncommunication, facilities for people with disabilities, provision of privacy for patient examination\narea/ examination table, good quality lab, pharmacy, a wellness room for conducting physiotherapy/\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "35\nYoga sessions, rehabilitative services, separate toilets for males and females etc. may be included in\ninfrastructure upgrade.\nzz Major civil infrastructure upgrade would largely be required for developing the Sub Health Centres\nas Health and Wellness Centre. Essential requirements for strengthening a SHC to serve as a Health\nand Wellness Centres are:\nzA well-ventilated clinic room with examination space and office space for Mid-Level Health\nProvider/Community Health Officer.\nzStorage space for storing medicines, equipment, documents, health cards and registers.\nzDesignated space for lab/diagnostic.\nzSeparate male and female toilets.\nzDeep burial pit for Bio Medical Waste Management.\nzProper system for drainage.\nzAssured water supply that can be drawn and stored locally.\nzElectricity supply linked to main lines or adequate solar source, inverter or back-up generator as\nappropriate.\nzPatient waiting area covered to accommodate at least 20-25 chairs.\nzRepairs of roofs and walls, plastering, painting and tiling of floors to be undertaken as per\nrequirement.\nzSpace/room for Yoga if adequate space for expansion is available.\nzAdequate residential facilities for the service providers.\nzRain water harvesting facilities may be planned if required.\nzz Once the numbers of SHC to be upgraded as Health and Wellness Centres are final the identified\nblocks will need to systematically map Sub Health Centres: with and without buildings.\nzz For a PHC- HWC, infrastructure would be as per current Indian Public Health Standards.\nzz The concerned Block Medical Officer and a representative from the Engineering wing at the district\nlevel will do a joint site inspection and complete gap analysis for repair/renovation in existing\nbuildings. The analysis should be based on the essential requirements stated above and will support\nin estimating necessary financial resources.\nzz A costed prototype for planning civil modification of existing Sub Health Centres buildings and new\nconstruction will be made available by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.\nzz States and district should consider the earmarked fund support of 7 lakh/SHC-HWC or 4 lakh PHC-\nHWC as a pooled grant rather than fixed grant per facility for infrastructure modification.\nzz When new construction is being planned, location of HWCs should be decided through a consultative\nprocess involving community, gram panchayat members, community forest rights committees,\nfrontline health functionaries, Block Medical Officers and others. Construction of new building should\nbe preferably undertaken in a central location with high population density and not in peripheral\nsites of the villages. Acquiring of land for this purpose would be a priority for the district.\nzz To save time and optimize resources, identification of government buildings available with other\ndepartments could be prioritized for operationalizing HWCs after necessary renovation.\nzz Old dilapidated buildings should be considered for renovation only after careful review of resources\nrequired. Wherever existing sub-centres are in dilapidated condition, it will be more cost effective to\nplan for a new HWC.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "36\nzz Though financial provision for repair and new construction are made available under the National\nHealth Mission, resource mobilization for new construction could also be explored from different\ngovernment programmes such as- Members of Parliament/Members of Legislative Assembly Local\nArea Development Scheme, Labour component support available under Mahatma Gandhi National\nRural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), District Mineral funds wherever applicable, Untied\nfunds available with Local Self Governments in urban and rural areas, District Innovation Funds and\nother state government development programmes. Funding under NHM say, 50% support, should\nbe provided to leverage support from above mentioned potential sources. Support from Corporate\nSocial Responsibility and philanthropic organizations, NABARD, special funds like tribal affairs,\nminorities may also be explored.\nzz Convergent action will be needed at district level to identify land for new construction of HWCs. The\nMLHP/MPW (M/F) should be involved in site selection. This should be close to community and have\naccess to essential amenities.\nzz Private buildings could be taken on rent, may be as an interim measure, however; the buildings\nidentified should adhere to the specified infrastructure norms for strengthening a sub health centre\nto serve as a Health and Wellness Centres as much possible.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "7\nSE C T I O N\nMediCiNeS, diAGNOSTiCS\nANd OTHeR SUPPLieS\nThe credibility of a Health and Wellness Centre rests on the availability of essential medicines and diagnostics\nfor a wide range of health care needs of the population served by the HWC. In line with the paradigm shift\nenvisaged, the HWC will provide a broader range of services and this necessitates expanding the list of\nessential medicines and diagnostic services currently available.\n7.1. Medicines at HWC\nMedicines listed as per essential list of medicines for a PHC/Sub health Centre need to be ensured at\nrespective HWCs. Additional medicines will be required at the HWC as the range of services expands.\nSuggestive essential medicine list for a SHC-HWC is at Annexure 1. The indicative list of medicines is as per\nNational List of Essential Medicines 2015, this will be updated periodically based on new protocols and\nstates will have the flexibility to adapt the list as appropriate.\nCertain medicines for treatment of identified patients with chronic diseases (Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus,\nEpilepsy, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Mental Disorders, and patients requiring palliative care)\ncan be indented by the Mid-Level Health Provider, from the PHC/referral center essential medicine list. For a\npatient suspected of a chronic disease, confirmation and initiation of treatment will be by the Medical Officer\nat the PHC or a higher referral centre. However, for continuation of treatment, medicines will be dispensed at\nSHC-HWCs by MLHP to avoid patient hardship and ensure that the clinical condition is monitored regularly.\nBased on the records in the health folder (electronic/manual), the MLHP will generate each month, a list of\npatients on treatment for chronic illnesses in the population served by HWC. The IT system envisaged at the\nHWC level would help the MLHP in stock management and estimating the requirement of medicines based\non actual caseloads. According to the patient list, the MLHP can indent medicines from PHC- EML/ referral\ncentre- EML for a three - month period per patient. The medicines are provided every month to the patient.\nPatients would be encouraged to come to the HWC so that their health status can be monitored. Home\nbased distribution is recommended only for patients who are not able to travel. A list of these medicines is\nattached in Annexure 2.\n7.2. Diagnostics to be available at HWC\nThe HWC should have the capacity to deliver a minimum range of basic diagnostics and screening capabilities\nfor conditions that are mandated to be screened/treated at this level. Diagnostic services as per the Guidelines\nfor National Free Diagnostic Initiative need to be available at HWC (SHC-7 and PHC-19 investigations).\nIn addition, a Peak Flow Meter and Snellen’s and Near Vision Chart are recommended for inclusion at SHC-HWCs.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "38\n7.2.1. Point of Care Diagnostics\nThere is a plethora of diagnostics, several of them are “point of care” that are currently available. However, the\nchoice of those that need to be included should be taken after validation and Health Technology Assessment.\nOn completion of HTA, states may consider use of the innovative diagnostics solutions from those empanelled\nthrough Government E-Market Place. Pilots on use of innovative diagnostics solutions may be planned and\nlinked to innovation portal of NHM for further validation and Health Technology Assessment.\n7.2.2. Hub and Spoke Model\nWith regards to the diagnostic services at the HWC, the primary objective is to minimize the movement of\nthe patient and improve the timeliness of reporting. This can be achieved by following the hub and spoke\nmodel by creating the hub (Central Diagnostic Unit) at CHC or block level PHC for 20-30 HWCs, depending\non the distance and population served. State will need to define context specific protocols for peripheral\ncollection of samples from HWCs.\nAt the level of PHC- HWC, availability of diagnostics and medicine would be ensured as per the existing IPHS\nand Essential Medicine List PHC. A suggestive list of diagnostics to be available at HWC and CDU is attached\nin Annexure 3.\n7.3. Rational Use of Diagnostics and Medicines\nMedicines and diagnostics at the HWC should be made available as per the specified clinical pathways and\nstandard treatment guidelines for all services. Clear treatment protocols ensure the correct and efficacious\nuse of medicines and diagnostics. Monthly review meetings at sector PHC/ CHC will be a platform for\ndissemination of updated standard treatment protocols to the primary health care team. Service providers-\nMLHPs, MPWs and PHC staff will need to be trained to undertake counselling for rational use of medicines and\nappropriate consumptions based on treatment plan. States/Districts should plan for periodic prescription\naudits, robust quality checks on quality of medicines, use of IT system for ensuring rational use of medicines\nand diagnostics through periodic training of members from primary care team.\n7.4. Equipment and Supplies at HWC\nEquipment as well as consumables will be added at the HWC level in accordance with the expanded range\nof services. Similar to medicines, certain consumables will be indented by MLHP as per requirement from\nPHC/ referral centre. E.g. for home based palliative care of a patient in area catered by SHC-HWC, a kit will\nbe maintained by MLHP at HWC and required consumables will be indented. Indicative list of items for\nEquipment and Supplies is attached in Annexure 4. The list of equipment is exhaustive and can be made\navailable in incremental manner as range of services expand and budget provision increases.\n7.5. Streamlining Supply Chain Logistics\nIn order to provide the assured set of services detailed in the previous section, availability of essential\nmedicines and developing basic diagnostic facilities at the HWC is a priority. Issue of poor outcomes related\nto supply side deficiencies need to be addressed for this. Assured medicine availability closer to the homes of\npatients would support in treatment compliance for long term illnesses where patients generally discontinue\nthe treatment due to the challenges of medicine refills. It would also have an impact on the levels of out of\npocket expenditures and establish the credibility of public health care delivery system.\nThe first step would be to make all medicines as per the SHC- EML and consumables, equipment for\ndiagnostics listed as per the SHC- Indian Public Health Standards available at the HWC. Subsequently,\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "39\nadditional medicines and equipment as well as consumables for diagnostics will be added at the HWC level\nin accordance with the expanded range of services.\nThe Essential Medicine List will guide the procurement and supply of medicines. The DVDMS system needs\nto be extended to the PHC level in those states where it is operational and be enabled on a priority basis\nwhere it is yet to be implemented. In future, efforts will be made to incorporate demographics of patients in\ne-Aushadhi software- and enable linkage with patient wise consumption data to estimate real time need.\nIn order to ensure free medicines and diagnostics, the state will have to ensure a state level robust system for\nprocurement, involving real time utilization based indenting, well timed tendering, finalization of technical\nand financial bids, measures of rate contracting etc. A streamlined distribution, logistics and quality assurance\nis required that allows supply chain management to be responsive to changing and diverse patterns of\nconsumption of consumables across facilities.\n7.6. Planning Equipment and Supplies\nSPMU/DPMUs could plan to provide equipment and supplies under the following categories to enable\ndelivery of quality Comprehensive Primary Health Care services:\nzz Medicines and Vaccines\nzz Clinical Tools, material and equipment\nzz Linens and Consumables\nzz Furniture and Fixtures\nzz Laboratory and Diagnostic Materials\nMost of these equipment and materials indicated in annexure would be available in the existing Health\nSub health Centres. An efficient utilization of resources would demand a sub-centre wise gap analysis of\navailable materials to avoid duplication and plan procurement only for those items, which are either not\navailable, not functional or required in additional quantity.\n* In case of creating HWCs at the PHCs, additional provision can be made for equipment at Wellness Room, which would involve-basic physiotherapy\nequipment, tools for exercise, mats etc. for arranging yoga sessions. In addition, a spirometer needs to be available at PHCs linked to HWCs, for confirmation\nof COPD.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",

  "8\nSE C T I O N\nQUALiTY Of CARe\nTo ensure effective delivery of primary health care services, it is essential that protocols for quality assurance\nare institutionalized at HWC. Mere availability of services is not enough and the services need to be accessible,\nsafe, patient-centred, acceptable, equitable and provided with dignity and confidentiality. In order to assure\nthat quality standards are followed. the following critical measures should be taken:\na. Provision of Patient Centred and respectful care.\nb. Enable Patient Amenities at HWC.\nc. Adhere to standard treatment guidelines and clinical protocols for care provision.\nd. Achieve Indian Public Health Standards with regards to HR, infrastructure, equipment, service\ndelivery and supplies.\ne. Implement the National Quality Assurance Standards for public health facilities, by focusing on eight\ncritical areas - a) Service provision, b) Patient rights, c) Inputs d) Support services, e) Clinical services,\nf) Infection control, g) Quality management and h) Health outcomes.\n8.1. Patient Centred Care\nThe care in the community, at outreach and at the HWC should be responsive to needs, respectful and\nmeet the aspirations of individual service users. It should be delivered in ways that take into cognizance the\ndignity of the individual, the needs and circumstances of the family, and the culture of the community. The\nHWC has been conceived so that the smaller populations, the team based approach and the availability of\na large number of services enable a more improved patient provider relationship, and the establishment of\ntrust in the public health system.\n8.2. Standard Treatment Guidelines\nCompliance to Standard Treatment Guidelines would enhance safety and improve patient outcomes.\nIt would also enable parameters of uniform standards of care delivery among service providers across different\nlevels of care and would facilitate continuity of care for patients. The STGs would enable identification of\nmedicines that can be dispensed and administered at the primary care / HWC level. In addition, STGs would\ndefine for each level of care, the management of the specified condition with referral linkages, requirement\nof medicines, diagnostics, consumables and skill sets required. As an immediate step, states should ensure\nthat all existing Standard Treatment Guidelines under various national health programmes are available at\nHWC level and are adhered to through close supervision and monitoring.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "42\n8.3. National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS)\nNational Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) will be developed for HWC. The primary health care team\nwould be trained to assess and improve key processes to deliver safe, timely, and accessible care. Similar\nto the process of accreditation followed in case of other facilities, the achievement of accreditation in HWC\nwould also enable recognition and awards.\nOther quality measures include implementation of Infection Control Measures, Biomedical Waste\nManagement, and patient satisfaction and survey measures.\nKey points to consider while ensuring quality:\nzz Experience from implementing NQAS in preparation for certification indicates that while availability\nof standards is crucial, it does not actually translate in to outcomes.\nzz Provider competency, behaviour, attitude and efforts are critical for delivering quality services,\nparticularly at the HWC level, since this will serve as the first point of entry in to the system. Provider\nperformance will in turn depend upon training, availability of STGs, protocols, supervision, and\nfeedback.\nzz The MoHFW is in the process of developing standards for process and outcomes for ambulatory\ncare, particularly focussed on effectiveness and patient safety.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",

Health Promotion and Social Behavioural Change Communication\nHealth promotion and information provision at the community level is an integral part of the expanded\nrange of services under Comprehensive Primary Health Care. Health is affected by various social and\nenvironmental determinants and actions to address these issues often do not fall in the purview of health\nsystems alone and therefore requires intersectoral convergence and people’s participation.\nThe Health Promotion strategy recommended by the National Health Policy 2017 emphasizes\ninstitutionalizing intersectoral coordination at national and sub-national levels to optimize health\noutcomes, through constitution of bodies that have representation from relevant non-health ministries.\nThis should be in line with the emergent international “Health in All” approach as complement to Health for All.\nAs envisioned in the policy, States should plan for a coordinated action on seven priority areas for improving\nthe environment for health as part of CPHC:\nzz The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.\nzz Balanced, healthy diets and regular exercises.\nzz Addressing tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse.\nzz Yatri Suraksha – preventing deaths due to rail and road traffic accidents.\nzz Nirbhaya Nari –action against gender violence.\nzz Reduced stress and improved safety in the work place.\nzz Reducing indoor and outdoor air pollution.\nStates will need to develop strategies and institutional mechanisms in each of the seven areas, to create\n“Swasth Nagrik Abhiyan” –a social movement for health in the form of Jan Andolan. Indicators and targets\ncould also be defined to track progress for achievement in each of these areas.\n9.2. Target Groups for Health Promotion\nGiven below are few examples of health promotion strategies that can be planned for different target groups.\nThese are only illustrative and need to be expanded to develop a context specific health promotion strategy\nbased on local needs.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "44\n9.2.1. General Population\nThis group is targeted for primary prevention.\nExample:\nzz Population education on life style modifications such as healthy diet, regular exercise to prevent\ncardiovascular diseases and diabetes.\nzz Organizing sanitation drives for clean surroundings to prevent the spread of communicable diseases-\nmalaria, gastroenteritis etc.\nzz Nutrition counselling in adolescents and women in reproductive age group to address issues of\nlow birth weight in new-borns, promotion of early initiation of breastfeeding to prevent childhood\nillnesses.\nzz Displaying information by shopkeepers and retailers on High Fat Salt and Sugar (HFSS) Display Board\nwith information on the daily FSS requirement that is not to be exceeded etc.\nzz Including section on healthy diets and arranging special session to promote health nutrition habits\nin school going children etc.\n9.2.2. Population at Risk\nThis is for population groups, which have high risk of developing a disease/disorder and has higher exposure\nto risk factors.\nExample:\nzz Targeted Behavioural Change strategies for population at risk of HIV/AIDS such as- female sex\nworkers, MSM, truck drivers, migrant labours etc. and planning interventions to promote healthy\nbehaviours that include messages to- decrease the number of sexual partners, safe sexual intercourse,\ncounselling and testing for HIV, adherence to biomedical strategies -decrease sharing of needles\nand syringes, and decrease substance use etc.\nzz Ensure regular screening of adults for NCDs.\n9.2.3. Individuals with Symptoms\nThis is for individuals and population groups who show obvious signs of a disease condition.\nExample:\nzz Home visits by frontline functionaries for early identification of symptoms, prompt referral and\nfollow up of cases like high-risk pregnancies, high-risk new born, malnourished children, and passive\nsurveillance for malaria etc.\n9.2.4. Population with Known Disorders\nExample:\nzz Individual and family counselling- for treatment compliance and lifestyle modifications through\nhome visits by ASHAs as part of interventions for NCDs, disease- based patient support groups –for\nimproved compliance, IEC activities using patient education leaflets, banners, posters, etc. for NCDs\nand other morbidities.\nNote: Health promotion is not restricted to health education and behaviour change communication; but it has a broader\nperspective and includes all responsive measures discussed above; which have a direct or indirect bearing on health such\nas inequities, changes in the patterns of consumption, environment, cultural beliefs etc.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "45\n9.3. Ensuring Wellness and Health Promotion through YOGA and Mainstreaming\nof AYUSH\nUnder Ayushman Bharat India’s rich tradition of indigenous health, system and Yoga will be mainstreamed\ninto the health care delivery system, by actively engaging practitioners of these systems. Health and Wellness\nCentres provide a sound platform for enabling this integration. This will require close coordination with\nMinistry of AYUSH/Department of AYUSH at the state and district level. To operationalize integration with\nYoga and AYUSH, states and districts will need to:\nzz Identify a pool of Local Yoga Instructors at the HWC level. These could be an ASHA, ASHA Facilitator,\nPhysical Instructor from village school, representatives from VHSNC, or other NGO groups active in\ncommunity.\nzz Plan for systematic graded training and certification of these local Yoga Teachers. Department of\nAYUSH will lead this activity by identifying a pool of YOGA experts/YOGA schools who can undertake\nthis training at the state/district/Sub-district level.\nzz Fix and widely disseminate weekly/monthly schedule of classes for Community Yoga Training at\nthe HWCs. If space permits these classes could ideally be held in premises of HWC or in the nearby\nschool, Panchayat Bhawan or even AWC.\nzz Earmark and disburse incentive/honorarium for these YOGA teachers that could be provided on a\nper session basis.\nzz Fix one day a week for conducting Ayurveda Clinics. These will particularly aim for useful diet\ncounselling, management of chronic aches and pains, elderly care etc.\n9.4. Agents and Platforms for Health Promotion\n9.4.1 Mid-Level Health Provider\nMLHP will provide individual and family based health promotion in HWCs and community. The MLHP will\ncoordinate the health promotion activities via frontline workers, VHSNCs/MAS/SHGs/NGOs and patient\nsupport groups. The MLHP will ensure that it reaches all segments of population.\n9.4.2 ASHA\nzz ASHAs have been an important community level resource to improve access to health care services\nin the areas of RCH and communicable diseases. The shift from ‘selective primary healthcare’ to\n‘Comprehensive Primary Health Care’ would require ASHAs to play a key role as member of primary\nhealth care team at HWC. Continuing to perform their three roles– that of a facilitator, health\nactivist and service provider at the community level she will be vital in improving access to care and\nundertake health promotion activities. However, focus of her work will now encompass wider range\nof services of RCH and communicable diseases to new services such as management of common\nNCDs, ophthalmology, oral health, elderly and palliative care. ASHAs would be able to provide the\nnew services being rolled out under CPHC.\nzz As some of these conditions are chronic involving long-term treatment and life style modifications\nfor management, ASHAs would need additional capacity building to undertake the tasks of health\npromotion, timely referral and active follow up for compliance.\nzz Health Promotion by ASHAs would use the same principles of listing the target population,\ncommunity mobilization, supporting the HWC team in organizing camps (like VHNDs/ UHNDs) on\na periodic basis, reaching the marginalized, support treatment compliance and follow up similar to\nfollow up of her existing beneficiaries (pregnant women, new born and TB/ Leprosy patients etc).\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",

Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees, Mahila Arogya Samitis, Self-Help\nGroups, Women Collectives\nzz VHSNC/ MAS are key community level forums to facilitate intersectoral convergence, local planning\nand action to address issues related to access and quality of care. They should lead the community\naction plan for surveillance and action on vector- borne disease control programmes, addressing risk\nmodification for common NCDs, and undertaking social health campaigns for health promotion.\nzz VHSNC/ MAS should also engage with existing women groups and ensure greater participation\nof women to enable gender equity and promoting women’s health issues. VHNSC should actively\ninvolve with Panchayat Raj Institutions representatives to build capacities for community level\nplanning, action and monitoring to address social determinants of health. In urban areas, MAS\nwould need to work closely with the representatives of Urban Local Bodies and existing community-\nbased groups. Such joint efforts would be useful to undertake activities such as addressing sources\nreduction for vector borne diseases, promoting regular exercise and sports to promote healthy life\nstyles, supporting the primary care team in outreach activities, reaching remote hamlets, and acting\nagainst alcohol, tobacco and other forms of substance abuse.\nzz The VHSNC/MAS, ASHA and her support mechanisms will play a critical role in delivery of\nComprehensive Primary Health Care by demand generation for Health and Wellness Centres.\nThey will need to undertake large-scale community level IEC activities planned in the form of\ncampaigns, distribution of print materials and through folk programmes. These campaigns would\ninform the community about services offered at HWCs.\nzDetails of the service providers-Multi-purpose workers, ASHA, Mid-Level Health Providers and\nPHC Medical Officers.\nzBenefits of HWC (closely accessible, Medicines available for all common ailments, collection of\nmedicine refills, reduction in the chances of incurring out of pocket expenditure by families etc.)\nzOpening hours and location, importance of enrolment in HWC and availing the first screening\nservices.\nzz These agents of Health Promotion will also play a critical role in building awareness for the other\npillar of Ayushman Bharat-The PMJAY and inform the community about the various government\nschemes for financial risk protection and in helping the people understand where to avail, how to\navail these schemes, who are the providers, what are specific entitlements under these schemes and\nwhat are the mechanisms of linkages for availing these health insurance benefits.\nStates will need to develop a monthly calendar of activities/campaigns/meetings for engagement of VHSNCs/\nMAS. This will support in organizing systematic action on health promotion activities to be undertaken by\nthese groups.\n9.4.4.

PSGs provide a platform wherein patients with\nsimilar illness and their family members or caregivers can have an open discussion about the disease,\nchallenges associated with the illness and its treatment.\nzz Such groups would help patients and their family members by providing mutual support, providing\ninformation about diseases, raising awareness about complications, countering discrimination\nand stigma attached to a particular disease and enabling support for treatment continuation and\nchanges in lifestyle behaviour.\nzz The ASHA should be actively engaged in facilitating these group discussions and must ensure that\nindividuals from marginalised groups with the same disease condition are supported to become\npart of these groups.\n9.4.5. AYUSHMAN Ambassadors\nzz In addition to Health and Wellness Centres and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, the Ayushman\nBharat aims to create about 2.2 million Health and Wellness Ambassadors in 1.1 million public\nschools for prevention and promotion of diseases among school children.\nzz The Ayushman Ambassadors or the Health and Wellness Ambassadors will be schoolteachers (one\nmale and one female) who will be responsible for age appropriate learning for promotion of healthy\nbehaviour and prevention of various diseases at the school level. This programme will ensure age\nappropriate skill-oriented, theme-based sessions for schoolchildren for which “Health and Wellness\nAmbassadors” will be trained in graded curriculum to implement the activities at primary, middle\nand high school level.\nzz The training will help to transact health promotion and disease prevention information in the form\nof interesting activities for one hour every week. 20-hour sessions will be delivered through weekly\nstructured interactive classroom-based activities.\nzz Every Tuesday will be dedicated as Health and Wellness Day in the schools.\nzz These health promotion messages will also have bearing on improving health practices in the\ncountry and students will act as Health and Wellness Messengers in the society. This will help them,\ntheir parents and the families these students raise in future. Regular reinforcement of messages/\nthemes through IEC/BCC activities such as interactive activities/posters/class room/Assembly\ndiscussion and field level will need to be undertaken. Existing teacher capacity building mechanism\nand infrastructure of District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) will be appropriately utilized\nfor capacity building of Health and Wellness Ambassadors.\n9.5. Inter-Sectoral Convergence for Health Promotion\nzz Convergence is central for the success of health promotion strategies and require close\ncoordination of health with other allied departments. Convergence has so far been undertaken\nwith- education department for school- based health promotion camps, with ICDS for organizing\ncamps and community level educational meetings on healthy diet, immunization, addressing\nmalnutrition in children at AWCs during Village Health and Nutrition Days, with WCD for\nimplementing Weekly Iron and Folic Implementation programme/Rashtriya Bal Swasthya\nKaryakram in AWCs for children in 2-6 years age group. Convergence initiatives to address spread\nof outbreaks of communicable diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, malaria for sanitation\ndrives, vector control, controlling water coagulation, through cleaning of drains etc. are observed\nwith rural development or municipal bodies in rural and urban areas respectively.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "48\nzz Intersectoral convergence would now be required for promoting healthy behaviours related to\nNCDs. For example-different departments will need to come together to address the rising burden\nof dietary risk factors that are among the leading causes of health risk in Indian population and lead\nto increasing burden of death and disability from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and also from\ncancer. Eat Right Toolkit developed by FSSAI should also be used to promote healthy diets.\nzz Health department will need to ensure that programmes such as - Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram,\nRashtriya Kishore Swasthaya Karyakram, NPCDCS and Shaala Siddhi etc. to be focused now on both\nunder and over nutrition.\nzz Other than Ayushman Ambassadors convergence from education may help in promoting\nbetter cooking practices for Mid- Day Meal programmes, training of MDM cooks, for enabling\nmandatory School Nutrition Clubs and competitions around health awareness for High fat,\nsugar and salty foods.\nzz Similarly, coordination from Women and Child Development will help in building awareness on ill\neffects of overweight-obesity through its flagship programmes like Integrated Child Development\nServices (ICDS), Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS), Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana\n(IGMSY) and through SABLA, which mainly focuses on adolescent girls.\nzz Environmental Protection activities including provision of safe water, vector control, improvement of\nhousing, control measures to check poor air quality etc. will also require intersectoral convergence.\nzz The states should plan health education and communication strategy in close coordination with\nMinistry of Rural development. Meetings with Zilla Panchayat, Block Panchayat and and Gram\nPanchayat need to be planned, at the commencement of HWCs. Later phased meetings at each\nof these levels would support in planning avenues and strategies for health promotion related to\nvarious dimensions of primary care.\nzz Existing guidelines under all programmes of MOHFW need to be suitably amended in light of the\nenhanced capacities and services being rendered by the HWCs.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "10\nSE C T I O N\nPROGRAMMe MANAGeMeNT\nThe goal of delivering Comprehensive Primary Health Care effectively in an equitable manner requires\nsubstantial change management. Robust and effective management strategies would need to be adopted\nto facilitate among other things, re-organization of health care services, intersectoral convergence and\ninstitutionalize mechanism for performance-linked payment for service providers.\nSince the Comprehensive Primary Health Care approach relies primarily on integration of existing service\ndelivery structures of various programme components under the NHM and intersectoral convergence, it\nis important that the nodal officers of different programmes such as RCH, NPCDCS, NVBDCP, Community\nProcesses and Quality Assurance work in a coordinated manner, led by Assistant Mission Director or Joint /\nDeputy Director at the state level. Additional consultants (two for small states and three for big states) can\nbe hired to support the process of planning, implementation and monitoring.\nNodal officers for this initiative at district level would need to be carefully selected from the rank of Deputy CMHO\nor DPM or DCM, based on their past performance and commitment demonstrated to improve the public health\nsystems. It is desirable that an additional post is created at the district level programme management unit to\nmanage the CPHC roll out. Similarly, the nodal officer should be selected at the block level from BMO or BPM or\nBCM based on performance and commitment. Roles for CPHC Management staff are listed in Annexure 5.\nIn order to improve the management mechanisms, following processes would be institutionalized:\na. Performance based payments: Mechanisms of performance linked payments and team-based\nincentives would be introduced to improve the performance of the service providers at HWCs and\nthe overall performance of health systems.\nb. Use of iT tool for periodic review, supervision and monitoring: Reports generated and data\ncaptured by the IT system should be used during district and block level monthly meetings to\nencourage “conversations on data”. This would facilitate improving quality of care, improving\ncoverage of population and tracking health outcomes using the information available from the data\nso generated.\nc. Capacity Building: Regular capacity building of programme managers at all levels and service\nproviders through periodic workshops at state and district level should be conducted for refreshing\nskills and dissemination of new guidelines and protocols.\nd. Supportive Supervision: Monthly visits would be undertaken by the PHC MOIC to the SHC to\nprovide on the job mentoring and hand holding support. In addition, quarterly review meetings of\nblock nodal officers at district level and biannual meetings of district nodal officers at the state level\nshould be planned to act as a forum for performance review and problem solving.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "50\ne. Social recognition: In addition to team-based incentives, annual awards based on pre-defined\ncriteria can be introduced for Primary Health Care teams as well as individual performers at state\nand district level. This would create a sense of social recognition and may enhance the motivation\nlevels of the Primary Health Care team to improve the performance.\nThe change management for this strategy would also require extensive public health and technical expertise.\nThe National Health Systems Resource Centre would provide technical support to all States/UTs for strengthening\nprimary health care and operationalizing HWCs. It is recommended that states should identify reputed Public\nHealth Organizations/Academic/Research Organizations available within the government or Non-Government\nOrganization to serve as the State Level Technical Partners in rolling out the Comprehensive Primary Health\nCare services through Health and Wellness Centres. The process of selection of Technical Partners would be state\nspecific and could involve a process of composite bidding with higher weightage for technical competence than\ncost-based parameters alone. States could also use an already existing Technical Agency such as the State Health\nResource Centers, working under a formal agreement with the State NHM/Departments of Health, which has\ndemonstrated expertise and competence in supporting other government initiatives.\nFigure 10.1 Program Management Structure\nnaTional leVel\nNHM division, Ministry of health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and National\nHealth Systems Resource Centre (NHSRC) as technical support\nMission Director NHM to supervise implementation\nDirector/Additoonal Director/Joint Director supported by SHSRC and similar\nall Program Officers and team of consultants institutions\nCMHO or a dedicated Program Officer supported by\nDPM/DCM\nBMO supported by BPM/BCM\n10.1. Monitoring\nThe designated programme management team at state and district level would be responsible for overall\nmonitoring and supervision of the HWCs. At field level, the block nodal officer oversees the HWC roll out and\nmonitors the progress made on a monthly basis. The IT platform would support generation of reports for\npopulation-based indicators and disease surveillance for effective programme monitoring at block, district\nand state level. States should use the existing indicators and data sources for monitoring till the IT system is\nable to provide programme specific reports.\nIn addition to the regular supervision and monitoring by the programme managers, states can also make the\nprovision for Independent Monitoring to assess the effectiveness of the programme, evaluate the service\ndelivery outputs, track improvements in health outcomes or for assessing the performance of HWCs team\nfor the disbursal of team-based incentives.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",
  "51\nStates can identify technical agencies, public health organizations, academic institutions and research\norganizations to serve as Independent Monitors. Support of national and state level technical partners can\nbe taken for the selection of such agencies for Independent Monitoring.\nThe following indicators may be used for monitoring the HWC services during the first phase.

Dial 104 Helpline should be universalised and capture grievances or gaps relating to\nHWCs.\n10.3. Community Based Monitoring and Social Accountability\nThe institutional frameworks set up for Community Based Monitoring and ensuring social accountability\nunder the National Health Mission would continue to be strengthened to support the process of CPHC\nimplementation. The facility surveys, preparation of score sheets and wide dissemination of the results\nthrough public hearings and dialogues will also be applicable for Health and Wellness Centres. Institutional\nstructures operational for community-based monitoring such as Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition\nCommittees and Community Action for Health will monitor delivery of preventive, promotive and curative\nservice as part of CPHC and will continue to provide relevant inputs for decentralized health planning.\nThis will support in increasing the accountability of the primary healthcare system to the Community and\nservice users.\nAs has been made mandatory for other public health facilities under NHM, it would be compulsory for all\nthe Health and Wellness Centres to prominently display information regarding financial support received,\nmedicines and vaccines in stock, services provided to the patients as citizen’s charter etc.\nThe VHSNCs/MAS facilitated by ASHAs/MPWs-F at the community level, the Rogi Kalyan Samitis at the\nfacility level and structures for Community Action for Health would monitor the performance of the Health\nand Wellness Centres and other facilities in terms of- delivering the extended ranges of services, minimizing\nout of pocket expenditures by service users, free provision of essential medicines and diagnostics, patient\ncentric care provision etc and suggest corrective measures for improving the performance.\nAll Public Reports on Health at the National, State and the district levels would report progress made on\nimplementation of Comprehensive Primary Health Care. States should nominate and involve Civil Society\nOrganizations, NGOs and other resource institutions and create a monitoring arrangement to track the\nprogress, effectiveness and quality of health services.\nAYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers",

E.g., Infrastructure strengthening may vary from Nil to\nRs. 15 Lakh per SHC as per the condition of the building in different contexts.\nIn addition to these budgetary allocations, the untied funds for SHCs would be Rs. 50,000 per HWC to meet\nadditional and non- anticipated requirements for delivery of CPHC services.\n11.2 Performance Linked Payments\nOne of the key features of the HWCs is the introduction of performance-linked payments for service providers\nfollowing the capitation-based payment models. This has been envisaged to improve the quality of services\ndelivery by incentivizing providers to ensure better health outcomes for the population in the catchment\narea. This shift in payment mechanism, in our context, would also address perceived challenge of poor\nperformance of the providers in public health facilities.\nThis would be achieved by linking one proportion of the salary with the performance/service delivery and\nproviding team based incentives based on improvement in health outcomes.\na. Performance Based Payments: All service providers at HWCs i.e.; Mid- level Health Providers (at\nSHC-HWC), Medical Officers and Staff Nurses at PHCs/ UPHCs HWCs can receive 60% of their salary\nas a fixed remuneration while remaining 40% the salary may be linked with the performance based\non measurable performance indicators.
