  "3 2. OUTLINE OF THE PROCESS DOCUMENT 2.1. Standard treatment guidelines (STGs) for Efficient Health Care A minimum standard of care is needed by every individual seeking medical treatment in a healthcare facility or by a healthcare professional. For any clinical conditions, it is imperative for health caregivers to be guided by standard care guidelines/pathways to complement them to provide an acceptable level of quality care to the patients. Hence formulating STGs could be a beacon for health care. Given the emphasis that is being placed on health under the various ministries of the Government of India, methodical planning like STG could provide an umbrella for medical professionals and for patients too. This is not just an ambitious step but an essential one that could revolutionize health care not only in India but probably in most developing countries. It would entail keeping the fin",

  "4 4. RATIONALE FOR STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES “Standard Treatment Guideline (STG) is a systematically developed statement designed to assist practitioners and patients in making decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances” – World Health Organization (WHO) (1) 4.1. Purpose and Content An effectively implemented guidelines (STGs) is advantageous for beneficiaries, healthcare providers, supply managers, and health policy makers. Global Scenario Back in 1999, when clinical guideline development was soaring in Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa, a published article (2) mentioned the potential benefits and limitations of developing clinical guidelines across health care professionals, patients, and health systems. The focus was clinical guidelines being the only way to improve quality of care, and limitations were on the quality in the",
  "ients, and health systems. The focus was clinical guidelines being the only way to improve quality of care, and limitations were on the quality in the development of the guidelines, including the group members, influence of opinions and clinical experience, and optimization of patient`s perspective. The article emphasized on rigorous development of evidence-based guidelines minimizing the potential risks, or it could lead to suboptimal, ineffective, or harmful practices. STGs are currently in use in parts of the United States, Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Western Pacific. As has been seen that improper use or misuse of medicines in the treatment of any medical condition is rampant, which can be detrimental to people. The idea behind having STG is to have standardisation in terms of treatment and promote effective and efficient treatment options. Such guidelines may be use",
  "a behind having STG is to have standardisation in terms of treatment and promote effective and efficient treatment options. Such guidelines may be used at different stages of the therapeutic process. It could include medical supplies as also following prescribed treatments. It could assist in better diagnosis and look at preventive services. As STGs are disease-specific, a publication of relevant documents and their proper updation would help medical practitioners. If implemented properly, STGs can be inclusive in their application (1). The HWCs herald a whole new scene in increasing responsiveness of health care services and in reaching the needs of marginalized sections of society with primary health care teams. Several Sub health Centers (SHCs), Primary Health Centers (PHCs) and Urban Health Centers (UHCs) are going to be made into Health Wellness Centers by 2022. The second component",
  " (SHCs), Primary Health Centers (PHCs) and Urban Health Centers (UHCs) are going to be made into Health Wellness Centers by 2022. The second component under Ayushman Bharat is the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana or AB PM-JAY as it is popularly known. This scheme was launched on 23rd September 2018 in Ranchi, Jharkhand by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi. National Health Authority (NHA) is the Nodal Agency set up for scheme implementation and oversight. AB PM-JAY is the largest health assurance scheme in the world which aims at providing a health cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to over 10.74 crores poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) that form the bottom 40% of the Indian population.

  "es) that form the bottom 40% of the Indian population. The primary objectives for launching AB PM-JAY were to ensure comprehensive coverage for catastrophic illnesses, reduce catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure, improve access to hospitalisation care, reduce unmet needs, and to converge various health insurance schemes across the States. The benefit cover under the scheme includes INR 5,00,000 on a family floater basis which can be used by one or all members of the family. AB PM-JAY has been designed in such a way that there is no cap on family size or age of members. In addition, pre-existing diseases are covered from the very first day. This means that any eligible person suffering from any medical condition before being covered by AB PM-JAY will now be able to get treatment for all those medical conditions as well under this scheme right away without any waiting period.",

  "5 Even after two decades, we stand at the same platform with an overwhelming minimal size of literature in some specialties. Guidelines are developed by the expert panel and are graded differently from evidence-based practices, which increases the individual variability among care providers and might have a difference of opinion. Developing homogenous clinical care can also be considered difficult to implement as patients, and clinical circumstances are heterogeneous. Hence, some variability and flexibility in the practices were productive. The study focused on the importance of the following parameters, clearly defined scope of the guideline, grading system of evidence-based practices, external peer review, and regular updating (3). The Agency for Healthcare research and quality addressed the challenges in measuring care co-ordination using electronic data. These included (4): 1. Underu",
  "ency for Healthcare research and quality addressed the challenges in measuring care co-ordination using electronic data. These included (4): 1. Underutilization of health IT system capabilities and clinical workflow barriers. 2. Lack of data standardization and limited health IT system interoperability. 3. Unknown clinical data quality in electronic data sources. 4. Limitations in linking data. 5. Technical hurdles to accessing data. 6. Business models that facilitate competition rather than cooperation. Potential solutions addressed to the above-mentioned challenges included structured data fields into the IT systems instead of text free writing and utilizing support staff to enter some information helps in care co-ordination; mapping consistencies in the coding system at the granular level example like medication units, laboratory results, diagnosis, etc. It also covered developing ind",

Indian perspective Studies from India explicated developing guidelines from many States and authorities, but major limitations as stated in KOLI et al. (5) in implementation included “multiplicity, paucity of Indian literature, failure to periodically revise guidelines, failure to tailor them according to the level of healthcare and a lack of availability and accessibility” making India dependent on the quality of ev",
  " failure to tailor them according to the level of healthcare and a lack of availability and accessibility” making India dependent on the quality of evidence from developed countries. It was also noticed that in the UK, one statutory body (NICE) developed, promoted, and disseminated the guidelines nationally, whereas the USA, on the other hand, had multiple agencies framing the STGs based on high-quality evidence. USA STGs and NICE guidelines did not reveal the cost of treatment and nor strategized on levels of healthcare. Other studies (6,7) explained the main challenges for initiating the STG development process itself, including a vague understanding of the mechanism, onboarding expertise panel, challenges to streamline specialists and generalists, international adaptation of pragmatic approach, time constraint, lengthy process, and financial support to sustain the task force.

However, adapting/adopting evidence-based guidelines should be allaying to the local context tailored to diverse clinical practice, varied resource settings, and acceptance by the prescribers. Though there are many standardized adaptation frameworks available, a uniform global approach, especially for developing countries, can ease the process to suit the local context. Investments in a National nodal agency to either adopt, adapt or develop STGs along with dissemination, impact evaluation, and timely revision were considered crucial. All in all, there is a substantial evidence on the benefits of STGs focusing on rationalizing health care services, thereby improving the quality of care.

However, standardization of developing frameworks, grading evidence-based practices, local context research for effectiveness of interventions, peer review, easy availability of the guidelines, finance allocations, increasing awareness, multiple revisions, decreasing multiplicity, feedback and update, standard electronic abstraction approach, and monitoring and evaluation are the key takeaways not only for the development but also for sustainability throughout the organizational strata including healthcare professionals, policymakers, patients, and insurers.",
  "6 4.2. Advantages as stated by WHO (1) The uses of STGs are multifarious and can take under its wings health care givers, health care officials, supply management personnel, and patients. • Health care providers - Provides standardized guidance to practitioners - Encourages high quality care by directing practitioners to the most appropriate medicines for specific conditions - Encourages the best quality of care since patients are receiving optimal therapy - Utilizes only formulary or essential medicines, so the health care system needs to provide only the medicines in the STGs - Provides valuable assistance to all practitioners, especially to those with lower-level skills - Enables providers to concentrate on making the correct diagnosis because treatment options will be provided for them • Health care officials - Provides a basis for evaluating quality of care provided by the health ca",

  "consequences. Care needs to be taken to shun misinformation for care providers. Inappropriate or ambiguous guidelines would do more harm than good. Hence, this aspect should receive attention while drafting proper guidelines. • STGs should not be limited to evaluation of a patient or a given fit of a standard treatment as it would give wrong signals of security. • In a rapidly developing field of medical care with latest developments in diagnostics and treatment, although developing and updating guidelines at regular intervals is a humongous task it must be done before they get obsolete.",
  "7 4.4. Aim and Objectives The aim of having STGs was to develop guidelines for AB PM-JAY Health Benefit Packages by adoption and customization of available Standard Treatment Workflows developed by DHR/ICMR, National Cancer Grid (NCG), State Guidelines, Ministry guidelines, and other globally accepted standard treatment protocols as per the scheme’s requirement. The objectives of STGs are to aid the Pre-authorization Processing Doctor (PPD) and Claims Processing Doctor (CPD) at the time of pre-authorization and claims processing by specifying the mandatory documentation required and specific things to look for in these documents for the prescribed procedure; to help prevent and control fraud and abuse; to provide quality care to the beneficiaries by bringing uniformity in documentation across empanelled healthcare providers; and to serve as a Guidance Tool for treating doctors, Empanelle",

Process carried out at DHR/ICMR for developing STWs It was felt that various prevailing treatment guidelines were not easy to follow and hence were not properly utilized by the busy clinicians in India as the workload is much higher than other smaller countries. This led to the formulation of Standard Treatment Workflows (STWs) that were designed in such a manner that they were user-friendly at the same time keeping in mind the feasibility of the country’s health system in the background. Department of Health Research-Indian Council of Medical Research (DHR-ICMR) created a three-peer",
  "ity of the country’s health system in the background. Department of Health Research-Indian Council of Medical Research (DHR-ICMR) created a three-peer review mechanism to give a concrete shape to the workflows. Subject expert group committees were formed by inviting clinical experts from Premier Medical Institutes, Medical Colleges and private sector. A Secretariat was created staffed by clinical scientists and lead by a Public Health Expert with sound clinical background to navigate the discussions in a format that was resource stratified. An Editorial Board was created to streamline the care pathways. The Advisory Committee gave supportive supervision to the whole exercise. ICMR STWs were developed to formulate treatment algorithms for common and serious medical and surgical conditions for both Out-patient Department (OPD) and In-patient department (IPD) management at primary, secondar",

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES The roles and responsibilities for implementation & roll out of STGs are divided across NHA and SHA. Implemen- tation of STGs is a collaborative effort of all stakeholders. The Hospital Policy & Quality Assurance (HP&QA) division at NHA referred to the available guidelines and literature for adapting them to the AB PM-JAY packages and developed package specific guidelines. Once reviewed and approved, the HP&QA and the IT team at NHA integrated them in the TMS (one of the IT platform of NHA). Once integrated, it is the responsibility of NHA, SHA, EHCPs, ISA and TPAs to ensure that these are implemented in the field and monitored by NHA and SHA. 11.

The hospitals can also refer to this document to have an insight on how the pre-auth and claims will be processed. However, this document doesn’t provide any guidance on clinical and therapeutic management of patient. In that respect the hospitals and physicians may refer to other relevant material as per the extant professional norms and the professional judgment of the healthcare professionals should be used for management of the patient. 12",
  "Part-I For Empanelled Healthcare providers – It gives the Guidelines for Clinicians and Healthcare Providers. This includes key clinical pointers such as signs, symptoms, indications, contraindications, admission, discharge and referral criteria, etc. It will also guide the MEDCO to select the appropriate package by guiding on what to look for in the documents/ clinical notes of the patient and give a glimpse of the standard treatment workflow referred. This part also lists down the mandatory documents required to be submitted by the EHCPs both at the time of pre-auth and claims submission. This will help reduce the number of queries raised to the hospital and the processing time as well if all the documents are complete and submitted on time.

CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNT 17.1. Challenges 1. Limited availability of MoH&FW & DHR-ICMR reference documents ICMR had recently released only 53 Standard Treatment Workflows (STWs). Similarly, limited guidelines were available under Clinical establishment act/ MoH&FW/state guidelines that could be mapped with AB PM-JAY packages. Some of them were old and not updated. Thus, pub",

Thus, publicly available information/ protocols/ guidelines in many national and international journals were also referred for getting relevant information and ensuring updated guidelines are shared with experts for their review and approval. 2. Disease/ Diagnosis to procedure mapping Most of the STWs/ clinical protocols of ICMR / MoH&FW/ NCG were disease/ diagnosis based. These had to be mapped with the procedures under AB PM-JAY. Many a times, for developing one STG, multiple procedures and multiple disease-based guidelines had to be mapped. 3. Non availability of many experts for timely feedback especially during pandemic Most of the experts are nationally / internationally acclaimed clinicians from some of the most reputed medical hospitals and ",
  "ecially during pandemic Most of the experts are nationally / internationally acclaimed clinicians from some of the most reputed medical hospitals and colleges in the country. Especially during the current pandemic and due to their engagement in additional tasks /responsibilities, the feedback from experts took a lot of time for review and finalization of the documents. Specialty prioritization had to be done based on availability of experts. Online discussions and personal follow-up were also done to ensure speedy review by experts. 4. State wise auto-approved and government reserved packages Many States have different packages as auto-approved and government reserved in contrast to the national master. The STGs for these States had to be integrated in IT system accordingly. 5. Pilots couldn’t be completed due to limitation on travel due to pandemic Pilots & orientation were conducted in",
  "ntegrated in IT system accordingly. 5. Pilots couldn’t be completed due to limitation on travel due to pandemic Pilots & orientation were conducted in 6 States/UTs only-Assam, Manipur, Kerala, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Chandigarh. Rest of the planned pilots had to be aborted due to the pandemic. 6. Limited implementation in States using their own IT system Some States are still using their State specific IT platform which limits the utilization of integrated STGs in these States except for portability cases. A separate orientation was held, and the IT documents required for customization were shared and followed up by sending communications to these States to integrate at the earliest.",
  "7. Initial plan for 30 abuse prone and 100 most utilized procedures was scaled up to all packages Development of STGs was conceptualized with an intent to develop the guidelines for only 30 most abuse prone packages and 100 most utilized procedures. However, this was later extended to all packages under HBP2.0 and corresponding HBP1.0 packages. The sudden increase in the requirement of STGs for all procedures was coupled with limited dedicated human resource for undertaking this task for development, review and integration in IT for which the team was later expanded. 8. Packages for most of the specialties were non-rationalized Many of the specialties where the packages were not rationalized in HBP2.0 and were adopted as it is at HBP1.0 rates including duplicacy in some packages across specialties. As a result of this some of the specialized mandatory investigations required could not be",
  "es including duplicacy in some packages across specialties. As a result of this some of the specialized mandatory investigations required could not be justified in the existing packages rates. While making STGs it was observed that, the non-rationalized packages of HBP 1.0 duplicating especially across specialties also had different rates. This also led to issues in mapping procedures as well. These will be addressed in the next revision of health benefit packages 3 (HBP3.0). Many States are still transitioning to HBP2.0 and STGs had to be mapped with non-rationalized packages of HBP1.0. 17.2. Lessons learnt 1.

Also, at times these were too ideal, which had to be matched with the on-field availability of the resources while striking a balancing between essential and ideal. 2. Only most essential mandatory documents to be included for public hospitals Some relaxation has been given to public hospitals for mandatory documents for each procedure considering the limited resources available and patient load in these hospitals at the time of pre-authorization. For private hospitals, mandatory documents have been kept stringent to prevent fraud and ensure quality care is given to the beneficiaries. 3.

With this objective, empanelment of hospitals (Hospital empanelment module (HEM 2.0)) which would be empowered to synchronise with the STGs has already begun. The empanelment criteria have been drawn from the guidance documents and the minimum requirements for hospitals to get into this criterion is formulated. Based on the inputs received from Experts and States (SHAs) an interim revision has been done in HBP 2.0 with the addition of a few more packages (now termed as HBP 2.1) which is in the process of being integrated so as to include new packages and procedures for common diseases.

Way Forward The trajectory ahead lies to complete integration and release of remaining STGs. It will be imperative to have periodic orientation and training in States/UTs/EHCPs. Systematic review of feedback from States/ hospitals/ TPAs & ISA (through States) will go a long way for strengthening of STG implementation.
