  "MUDRA LOAN SCHEME - SALIENT FEATURES 1. Brief background for introduction of MUDRA Loan Scheme by Govt. of India As per NSSO survey (2013), there are around 5.77 crore small/micro units in the country, engaging around 12 crore people, mostly individual proprietorship/Own Account Enterprises. Over 60% of units are owned by persons belonging to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe or Other Backward Classes. Most of these units are outside the formal banking system and hence are forced to borrow from informal sources or use their limited owned funds. MUDRA Loan Scheme has been proposed to bridge this gap. MUDRA Loan Scheme will aim to increase the confidence of the aspiring young person to become first generation entrepreneurs as also of existing small businesses to expand their activities. 2.
