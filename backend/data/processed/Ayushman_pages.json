Sharma National Health Authority\n\nChief Executive Officer\n18 November, 2021\n\nAyushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) is the flagship scheme of\nthe Government of India and the world’s largest health assurance scheme that provides a\ncover of up to 85 lakh per family per year, for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to\nover 10.74 crore vulnerable entitled families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries). PM-JAY\nprovides cashless and paperless access to over 1,670 health benefit packages across a\nnetwork of over 25,000 empanelled hospitals and health care providers in the country.\n\nDevelopment of the Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) is a key step towards delivering\nminimum acceptable standard of care as per extant norms. National Health Authority (NHA)\nhas been the pioneer in the introduction of the guidance documents for processing health\nbenefit packages. The objective of STGs is to serve as a guidance tool by providing mandatory\ndocument requirements for health benefit packages for Medical Coordinators (MEDCO),\nPreauthorisation Processing Doctors (PPDs), Claim Processing Doctors (CPDs), treating\ndoctors, empanelled healthcare providers (EHCPs), Third Party Administrators (TPAs),\nImplementation Support Agencies (ISAs), State Health Agencies (SHAs) and medical auditors.\nSTGs aid in delivering better healthcare outcomes by establishing accountability, timeliness\nof processing claims/payment, and verifiability of such standardised best practices and\nprocesses.\n\nThese documents are based on the standard treatment workflows / guidelines developed by\nDHR-ICMR, National Cancer Grid (NCG) lead by Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Ministry of\nHealth and Family Welfare (MoHFW), states, published literature, expert inputs, and\nprofessional associations. After being introduced on August 15, 2020, 599 STGs have already\nbeen released and integrated within the transaction management system (TMS) for 1,191\nprocedures listed under AB PM-JAY. With STG dashboards configured in the IT systems, the\nprocess to ensure compliance has been streamlined and the monitoring of deviations has\nbecome more effective.\n\nIn light of their contribution & support, | would like to express my gratitude to MoHFW, DHR-\nICMR, Tata Memorial Hospital, and all the stakeholders involved in building the Standard\nTreatment Guidelines.

  "3\n2. OUTLINE OF THE PROCESS DOCUMENT\n2.1. Standard treatment guidelines (STGs) for \nEfficient Health Care\nA minimum standard of care is needed by every \nindividual seeking medical treatment in a healthcare \nfacility or by a healthcare professional. For any clinical \nconditions, it is imperative for health caregivers to be \nguided \nby \nstandard \ncare \nguidelines/pathways \nto \ncomplement them to provide an acceptable level of \nquality care to the patients. Hence formulating STGs \ncould be a beacon for health care.\nGiven the emphasis that is being placed on health under \nthe various ministries of the Government of India, \nmethodical planning like STG could provide an umbrella \nfor medical professionals and for patients too. This is not \njust an ambitious step but an essential one that could \nrevolutionize health care not only in India but probably in \nmost developing countries. It would entail keeping the \nfinger on the pulse to include newer developments in the \nfields covering a plethora of diseases. The following \ndocument covers the advantage of STGs, its methodology \nin the application, and how it could prevent fraud \ntreatments in high-risk areas.\nAs has been detailed later in the document, many STGs/ \nclinical \nguidelines/ \nclinical \npathways \nhave \nbeen \nformulated \nfor \nyears \nby \nvarious \nclinical \nbodies/ \nfederations/ organizations. However, this is the first \nattempt \nmade, \nespecially \nthrough \nthe \nlargest \nGovernment-funded public health insurance/assurance \nscheme, to not just have package specific guidance \ndocuments but also have them integrated into the IT \nsystem to enable uptake and adherence to the \nguidelines. Further, a dashboard specific to these STGs \nhas also been developed for monitoring and analysis \npurposes. \n3. \nINTRODUCTION\n3.1. \nAyushman \nBharat \nPradhan \nMantri \nJan \nAarogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY)\nAyushman Bharat, a flagship scheme of Government of \nIndia, was launched as recommended by the National \nHealth Policy 2017, to achieve the vision of Universal \nHealth Coverage (UHC). This initiative has been designed \nto meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and its \nunderlining commitment, which is to \"leave no one \nbehind\". \nAyushman Bharat is an attempt to move from sectoral \nand segmented approach of health service delivery to a \ncomprehensive need-based health care service. This \nscheme aims to undertake path breaking interventions to \nholistically address the healthcare system (covering \nprevention, promotion and ambulatory care) at the \nprimary, secondary and tertiary level.\nAyushman Bharat adopts a continuum of care approach, \ncomprising of two inter-related components, which are -\n• Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs)\n• Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY)\nHealth and Wellness Centres (HWCs): These centers seek \nto promote individuals and communities to adopt healthy \nlifestyles and take control of their health by bringing \nservices closer to the community. They are therefore free \nto users and provide a wide variety of services including \nmaternal \nand \nchild \nhealth \nservices, \ncare \nfor \nnon-communicable diseases, palliative and rehabilitative \ncare, oral, eye and ENT care, mental health etc. To \nensure continuum of care, 1,50,000 health and wellness \ncenters will be set up with improved infrastructure, \nassured availability of drugs and diagnostic services \nalong with strengthening of referral mechanisms and \ncommunity linkages.",
  "4\n4. RATIONALE FOR STANDARD TREATMENT \nGUIDELINES\n“Standard Treatment Guideline (STG) is a systematically \ndeveloped statement designed to assist practitioners and \npatients in making decisions about appropriate health \ncare for specific clinical circumstances” – World Health \nOrganization (WHO) (1)\n4.1. Purpose and Content\nAn \neffectively \nimplemented \nguidelines \n(STGs) \nis \nadvantageous for beneficiaries, healthcare providers, \nsupply managers, and health policy makers.\nGlobal Scenario\nBack in 1999, when clinical guideline development was \nsoaring in Europe, North America, Australia, New \nZealand, and Africa, a published article (2) mentioned \nthe potential benefits and limitations of developing \nclinical guidelines across health care professionals, \npatients, and health systems. The focus was clinical \nguidelines being the only way to improve quality of care, \nand limitations were on the quality in the development of \nthe guidelines, including the group members, influence \nof opinions and clinical experience, and optimization of \npatient`s perspective. The article emphasized on rigorous \ndevelopment of evidence-based guidelines minimizing \nthe potential risks, or it could lead to suboptimal, \nineffective, or harmful practices. \nSTGs are currently in use in parts of the United States, \nEurope, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Western \nPacific. As has been seen that improper use or misuse of \nmedicines in the treatment of any medical condition is \nrampant, which can be detrimental to people. The idea \nbehind having STG is to have standardisation in terms of \ntreatment and promote effective and efficient treatment \noptions.\nSuch guidelines may be used at different stages of the \ntherapeutic process. It could include medical supplies as \nalso following prescribed treatments. It could assist in \nbetter diagnosis and look at preventive services. As STGs \nare disease-specific, a publication of relevant documents \nand \ntheir \nproper \nupdation \nwould \nhelp \nmedical \npractitioners. If implemented properly, STGs can be \ninclusive in their application (1).\nThe HWCs herald a whole new scene in increasing \nresponsiveness of health care services and in reaching \nthe needs of marginalized sections of society with primary \nhealth care teams. Several Sub health Centers (SHCs), \nPrimary Health Centers (PHCs) and Urban Health Centers \n(UHCs) are going to be made into Health Wellness \nCenters by 2022.\nThe second component under Ayushman Bharat is the \nPradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana or AB PM-JAY as \nit is popularly known. This scheme was launched on 23rd \nSeptember 2018 in Ranchi, Jharkhand by the Hon’ble \nPrime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi. National \nHealth Authority (NHA) is the Nodal Agency set up for \nscheme implementation and oversight.\nAB PM-JAY is the largest health assurance scheme in the \nworld which aims at providing a health cover of Rs. 5 \nlakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care \nhospitalization to over 10.74 crores poor and vulnerable \nfamilies (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) that form \nthe bottom 40% of the Indian population. \nThe primary objectives for launching AB PM-JAY were to \nensure \ncomprehensive \ncoverage \nfor \ncatastrophic \nillnesses, reduce catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure, \nimprove access to hospitalisation care, reduce unmet \nneeds, and to converge various health insurance schemes \nacross the States.\nThe benefit cover under the scheme includes INR \n5,00,000 on a family floater basis which can be used by \none or all members of the family. AB PM-JAY has been \ndesigned in such a way that there is no cap on family size \nor age of members. In addition, pre-existing diseases are \ncovered from the very first day. This means that any \neligible person suffering from any medical condition \nbefore being covered by AB PM-JAY will now be able to \nget treatment for all those medical conditions as well \nunder this scheme right away without any waiting period.",
  "5\nEven after two decades, we stand at the same platform \nwith an overwhelming minimal size of literature in some \nspecialties. Guidelines are developed by the expert panel \nand \nare \ngraded \ndifferently \nfrom \nevidence-based \npractices, which increases the individual variability \namong care providers and might have a difference of \nopinion. Developing homogenous clinical care can also \nbe considered difficult to implement as patients, and \nclinical circumstances are heterogeneous. Hence, some \nvariability and flexibility in the practices were productive. \nThe study focused on the importance of the following \nparameters, clearly defined scope of the guideline, \ngrading system of evidence-based practices, external \npeer review, and regular updating (3).\nThe Agency for Healthcare research and quality \naddressed \nthe \nchallenges \nin \nmeasuring \ncare \nco-ordination using electronic data. These included (4):\n1. Underutilization of health IT system capabilities and \nclinical workflow barriers.\n2. Lack of data standardization and limited health IT \nsystem interoperability.\n3. Unknown clinical data quality in electronic data \nsources.\n4. Limitations in linking data.\n5. Technical hurdles to accessing data.\n6. Business models that facilitate competition rather than \ncooperation.\nPotential solutions addressed to the above-mentioned \nchallenges included structured data fields into the IT \nsystems instead of text free writing and utilizing support \nstaff \nto \nenter \nsome \ninformation \nhelps \nin \ncare \nco-ordination; mapping consistencies in the coding \nsystem at the granular level example like medication \nunits, laboratory results, diagnosis, etc. It also covered \ndeveloping indicators for the evaluation of reliability and \naccuracy of IT data; linking data to policymakers and \npublic overcomes privacy barriers; designing the IT \nsystem for easy accessibility of data to end-users, and \nfinancial support to help overcome business model \nbarriers that have hindered information sharing and care \nco-ordination. \nIndian perspective\nStudies from India explicated developing guidelines from \nmany States and authorities, but major limitations as \nstated in KOLI et al. (5) in implementation included \n“multiplicity, paucity of Indian literature, failure to \nperiodically revise guidelines, failure to tailor them \naccording to the level of healthcare and a lack of \navailability and accessibility” making India dependent on \nthe quality of evidence from developed countries. It was \nalso noticed that in the UK, one statutory body (NICE) \ndeveloped, promoted, and disseminated the guidelines \nnationally, whereas the USA, on the other hand, had \nmultiple \nagencies \nframing \nthe \nSTGs \nbased \non \nhigh-quality evidence. USA STGs and NICE guidelines did \nnot reveal the cost of treatment and nor strategized on \nlevels of healthcare.\nOther studies (6,7) explained the main challenges for \ninitiating the STG development process itself, including a \nvague understanding of the mechanism, onboarding \nexpertise panel, challenges to streamline specialists and \ngeneralists, \ninternational \nadaptation \nof \npragmatic \napproach, time constraint, lengthy process, and financial \nsupport \nto \nsustain \nthe \ntask \nforce. \nHowever, \nadapting/adopting evidence-based guidelines should be \nallaying to the local context tailored to diverse clinical \npractice, varied resource settings, and acceptance by the \nprescribers. Though there are many standardized \nadaptation frameworks available, a uniform global \napproach, especially for developing countries, can ease \nthe process to suit the local context. Investments in a \nNational nodal agency to either adopt, adapt or develop \nSTGs along with dissemination, impact evaluation, and \ntimely revision were considered crucial.\nAll in all, there is a substantial evidence on the benefits of \nSTGs focusing on rationalizing health care services, \nthereby improving the quality of care. However, \nstandardization of developing frameworks, grading \nevidence-based practices, local context research for \neffectiveness \nof \ninterventions, \npeer \nreview, \neasy \navailability of the guidelines, finance allocations, \nincreasing awareness, multiple revisions, decreasing \nmultiplicity, feedback and update, standard electronic \nabstraction approach, and monitoring and evaluation are \nthe key takeaways not only for the development but also \nfor sustainability throughout the organizational strata \nincluding \nhealthcare \nprofessionals, \npolicymakers, \npatients, and insurers.",
  "6\n4.2. Advantages as stated by WHO (1)\nThe uses of STGs are multifarious and can take under its \nwings health care givers, health care officials, supply \nmanagement personnel, and patients.\n• Health care providers \n- Provides standardized guidance to practitioners \n- Encourages high quality care by directing practitioners \nto the most appropriate medicines for specific conditions  \n- Encourages the best quality of care since patients are \nreceiving optimal therapy\n- Utilizes only formulary or essential medicines, so the \nhealth care system needs to provide only the medicines in \nthe STGs \n- Provides valuable assistance to all practitioners, \nespecially to those with lower-level skills \n- Enables providers to concentrate on making the correct \ndiagnosis because treatment options will be provided for \nthem \n• Health care officials \n- Provides a basis for evaluating quality of care provided \nby the health care professionals \n- Provides the most effective therapy in terms of quality  \n- Provides a system for controlling cost by using funds \nmore efficiently \n- Provides information for practitioners to give to patients \nconcerning the institution’s standards of care \n- Can be a vehicle for integrating special programs (e.g., \ndiarrhoea disease control, acute respiratory infection \n(ARI), tuberculosis control, malaria) at the primary health \ncare facilities using a single set of guidelines \n• Supply management \n- Utilizes only formulary or essential medicines, therefore \nthe health care system needs to provide only medicines in \nthe STGs \n- Provides information for forecasting and ordering \n(because medicines and quantities for common diseases \nwill be known)   \n- Provides information for purchase of pre-packaged \nmedicines  \n• Patients \n- Patients receive optimal pharmaceutical therapy \n- Enables consistent and predictable treatment from all \nlevels of providers and at all locations within the health \ncare system \n- Allows for improved availability of medicines because of \nmore consistent use and ordering \n- Helps provide improved outcomes because patients are \nreceiving the best treatment regimens available \n- Lowers cost\n4.3. Points considered while drafting\nAB PM-JAY guidelines\n• Incomplete and inaccurate guidelines could provide \nmisinformation leading to wrong consequences. Care \nneeds to be taken to shun misinformation for care \nproviders. Inappropriate or ambiguous guidelines would \ndo more harm than good. Hence, this aspect should \nreceive attention while drafting proper guidelines.\n• STGs should not be limited to evaluation of a patient or \na given fit of a standard treatment as it would give wrong \nsignals of security.\n• In a rapidly developing field of medical care with latest \ndevelopments in diagnostics and treatment, although \ndeveloping and updating guidelines at regular intervals is \na humongous task it must be done before they get \nobsolete.",
  "7\n4.4. Aim and Objectives\nThe aim of having STGs was to develop guidelines for AB \nPM-JAY Health Benefit Packages by adoption and \ncustomization of available Standard Treatment Workflows \ndeveloped by DHR/ICMR, National Cancer Grid (NCG), \nState Guidelines, Ministry guidelines, and other globally \naccepted standard treatment protocols as per the \nscheme’s requirement.\nThe objectives of STGs are to aid the Pre-authorization \nProcessing Doctor (PPD) and Claims Processing Doctor \n(CPD) at the time of pre-authorization and claims \nprocessing by specifying the mandatory documentation \nrequired and specific things to look for in these \ndocuments for the prescribed procedure; to help prevent \nand control fraud and abuse; to provide quality care to \nthe beneficiaries by bringing uniformity in documentation \nacross empanelled healthcare providers; and to serve as \na Guidance Tool for treating doctors, Empanelled Health \nCare Providers (EHCPs), Third-party Administrators \n(TPAs), Implementing Support Agency (ISAs), State Health \nAgencies (SHAs) and medical auditors.\n4.5. \nProcess \ncarried \nout \nat \nDHR/ICMR \nfor \ndeveloping STWs\nIt was felt that various prevailing treatment guidelines \nwere not easy to follow and hence were not properly \nutilized by the busy clinicians in India as the workload is \nmuch higher than other smaller countries. This led to the \nformulation of Standard Treatment Workflows (STWs) that \nwere designed in such a manner that they were \nuser-friendly at the same time keeping in mind the \nfeasibility of the country’s health system in the \nbackground. Department of Health Research-Indian \nCouncil of Medical Research (DHR-ICMR) created a \nthree-peer review mechanism to give a concrete shape to \nthe workflows. Subject expert group committees were \nformed by inviting clinical experts from Premier Medical \nInstitutes, Medical Colleges and private sector. A \nSecretariat was created staffed by clinical scientists and \nlead by a Public Health Expert with sound clinical \nbackground to navigate the discussions in a format that \nwas resource stratified. An Editorial Board was created to \nstreamline the care pathways. The Advisory Committee \ngave supportive supervision to the whole exercise.\nICMR STWs were developed to formulate treatment \nalgorithms for common and serious medical and surgical \nconditions for both Out-patient Department (OPD) and \nIn-patient department (IPD) management at primary, \nsecondary and tertiary levels of India’s healthcare system \nthat are scientific, robust, and locally contextual (8). The \nobjective of these STWs was to ensure appropriate \ndisease management and quality services through \njudicious use of hospital-based interventions and the \ncreation of stronger referral linkages with other levels\nof care.\nFigure 1: The process flow adapted by NHA from conceptualization to rolling out the STGs\n5.

CONCEPTUALIZATION\nWith the vision of Universal Health Coverage, the \nNational Health Authority (NHA) worked in collaboration \nwith Department of Health Research (DHR/ICMR) and \nTata Memorial Hospital (TMH)/ National Cancer Grid \n(NCG) to rationalize the Health Benefit Packages (HBPs) \nand to have STGs in place for better implementation of \nthe AB PM-JAY scheme. \n8.1.Phase I\nIn Phase-I of the development, STGs were conceptualized \nand introduced only for the most abuse prone packages \n(Annexure 1). These were identified with the help of \nNational Anti-Fraud Unit (NAFU) team at NHA. Sixty such \npackages were identified; duplicates were removed and \nwere mapped with the 53 Standard Treatment Workflows \nreleased by ICMR. These guidelines and workflows were \nThe STGs would enable standardization of treatment \nprotocols across all empanelled healthcare providers, \ncontrol fraud and abuse, deliver cost effective and quality \ncare to the patients under the scheme. Starting with the \nmost abuse prone packages, the aim was to have in place \nguidelines for all the Health Benefit Packages under\nAB PM-JAY.\n8. OVERALL PLANNING\nFor the development and execution of the STGs, the process was strategically divided in two phases.\n7. INKED MoU/ MoA\n• NHA had inked a Memorandum of Association (MoA) \nwith DHR/ ICMR to provide support inter alia, in \ndeveloping STWs for various disease conditions / benefit \npackages under AB PM-JAY and undertake costing for \nrationalisation of health  benefit packages studies. \n• Simultaneously, MoA was also signed with Tata Memorial \nHospital (TMH) lead NCG to provide guidance for developing  \nOncology packages and guidelines. \n• Subsequently, NHA also signed a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding (MoU) with Ipas Development Foundation \n(IDF) as they approached to volunteer in providing \nsupport in drafting some of the Obstetrics and \nGynaecology STGs in their area of expertise and\nfield experience. \ncustomized for the AB PM-JAY packages and STGs were \ndeveloped. The developed STGs underwent extensive \ninternal and external expert review and were approved \nfor piloting in six volunteering States. The feedbacks \nshared by these States during the orientation and pilot \nwere considered and documents were revised.\nAbuse prone packages\nwere identified with the\nhelp of NAFU tream\nDHR/ICMR’s\nreleased 53 STW’s\nMapping\nSTG Development\nInternal &\nExpert review\nNHA approval\nPilot in 6\nvolunteering states",
  "Figure 3: Exploring and adapting wide range of guidelines for further integration\n8.2. Phase II\nDuring the pilot, many States had put up requests for \ndeveloping STGs for more packages and the exercise was \nextended to all Health Benefit Packages in Phase-II. Since \nonly 53 ICMR STWs were available, other sources of \nguidelines were explored for reference. Various national \nand international guidelines such as those of Ministry of \nHealth and Family Welfare (MoH&FW), State guidelines, \nNCG guidelines, WHO, NHS / NICE guidelines,\nWorld \nBank, \nFederation \nof \nIndian \nChambers \nof \nCommerce & Industry (FICCI) guidelines etc. were \nreferred. Similar to phase-I, these were mapped with AB \nPM-JAY packages and STGs were developed. The STGs \nunderwent internal and external expert review. The STGs \napproved by NHA were then integrated in the Transaction \nManagement System (TMS) and rolled out nationally\nin batches.\n8.2.1 Oncology STGs\nSimultaneously, for the rationalization of Oncology \npackages, TMH lead NCG in co-ordination with NHA \nworked parallely for development of Oncology \nSTG documents.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe roles and responsibilities for implementation & roll \nout of STGs are divided across NHA and SHA. Implemen-\ntation of STGs is a collaborative effort of all stakeholders. \nThe Hospital Policy & Quality Assurance (HP&QA) \ndivision at NHA referred to the available guidelines and \nliterature for adapting them to the AB PM-JAY packages \nand developed package specific guidelines.\nOnce reviewed and approved, the HP&QA and the IT \nteam at NHA integrated them in the TMS (one of the IT \nplatform of NHA). Once integrated, it is the responsibility \nof NHA, SHA, EHCPs, ISA and TPAs to ensure that these \nare implemented in the field and monitored by NHA\nand SHA.\n11. STRUCTURE OF GUIDELINES\nThe NHA team had deliberations with experts of varied \nspecialties and with consensus designed a format for the \ndeveloping guidelines. The structure was broadly divided \ninto four different parts and an introduction. \n11.1. Standard treatment guideline (Structure)\nThe Introductory part which comprises of Package and \nprocedure along with its HBP2.0 and HBP1.0 code \ncovered \nunder \nthe \nSTG, \nMinimum \nqualifications \n(Essential and Desirable) of the treating doctor, the \nempanelment criteria such as those pertaining to \nminimum \nessential \ninfrastructure \nrequired \nfor \nperforming that procedure for example a Cardiac Cath \nlab for performing Coronary Angiography, etc. and a \nDisclaimer which states that this document has been \nprepared for guidance of MEDCO, PROCESSING TEAM \nand TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM of AB \nPM-JAY for the Pre-auth and claims of all AB PM-JAY \npackages. The hospitals can also refer to this document \nto have an insight on how the pre-auth and claims will be \nprocessed. However, this document doesn’t provide any \nguidance on clinical and therapeutic management of \npatient. In that respect the hospitals and physicians may \nrefer to other relevant material as per the extant \nprofessional norms and the professional judgment of the \nhealthcare professionals should be used for management \nof the patient.\n12",
  "Part-I\nFor Empanelled Healthcare providers – It gives the \nGuidelines for Clinicians and Healthcare Providers. This \nincludes key clinical pointers such as signs, symptoms, \nindications, contraindications, admission, discharge and \nreferral criteria, etc. It will also guide the MEDCO to \nselect the appropriate package by guiding on what to \nlook for in the documents/ clinical notes of the patient \nand give a glimpse of the standard treatment workflow \nreferred. This part also lists down the mandatory \ndocuments required to be submitted by the EHCPs both \nat the time of pre-auth and claims submission. This will \nhelp reduce the number of queries raised to the hospital \nand the processing time as well if all the documents are \ncomplete and submitted on time. It aims to ensure \nuniformity of documentation and quality of care to the \nbeneficiaries.\nPart-2\nFor processing doctor (PPD/ CPD) - this section contains \nthe  guidelines for the processing team i.e. the PPD and \nCPD. It will guide them to determine the mandatory \ndocuments like relevant investigations, clinical notes, \npast history, etc. to look for in the case. The questions in \nit are specific to the procedure/package selected.\nPart-3\nIT guidance document - It includes one or more most \nsignificant alert question(s) at the hospital level. This part \nhas \nbeen \nincorporated \nin \nthe \nTMS \nin \nMEDCO \nquestionnaire. It will help in setting up cross check \nmechanisms/ rule engines and prevent booking of wrong \npackage.\nIn very few Obstetrics & Gynecology STGs, a Part 4 has \nbeen included that contains guidelines for Medical \nAuditors for some abuse prone packages.\nFigure 8: Four segments of STG structure\n13",
  "11.2. Structure for Oncology STGs\nThe structure for Oncology guidance documents was \ndeveloped with the support of TMH/NCG on similar lines \nas those for other specialties with a few modifications as \nthese were developed site wise such as breast, \nneurology, head & neck, urology, etc. The applicable \nmedical, surgical and radiation oncology packages were \nmapped and clubbed together in one document for each \nof these sites.\nFigure 9: STG framework for Oncology guidance documents\n14",
  "Table 2: Extensive review process and finalization of STGs\n12. DEVELOPMENT OF STGs\nA systematic, rigorous process flow was adhered to \nfinalize the STG guidance document, as shown in Table \n2. Once developed by the NHA team, the drafts were \noverseen by an in-house medical expert, modified, and \nthereafter shared with the respective specialty Expert for \nvetting and approval. Revisions were based on expert \nfeedback that included length of stay, minimum \nqualifications \nand \ninfrastructure, \nclinical \ncontent, \nmandatory documents, questionnaire, and triggers. The \nsuggestions for cross-specializations and changes in costs \nand package name/procedure for respective packages \nwere added to proposed amendments. Simultaneously, \nmany \npackages/procedures \nthat \nwere \nunder \ncross-specialty underwent review and approval of \nmultiple experts.\nThe last step in the process, the expert-approved \ndocument, was then put up to the competent authority at \nNHA for final approval and roll-out.\nTable 3 summarizes the work done in the STG \ndevelopment.

  "Figure 12: Overview of STG dashboard\n15. MONITORING AND ANALYSIS\nNHA plans to continuously monitor the adherence to \nthese guidelines through data analytics and artificial \nintelligence tools. STG dashboard was developed for \noverviewing the utilization of packages for which STG \nhad been launched, highlighting areas of further \nanalysis \nand \nmonitoring. \nWith \nthe \nobjective \nof \nmonitoring the level of compliance, improvement in \nquality of mandatory documents, areas that need \ntrainings, inputs from M&E team, NAFU team and IT \nteam were taken. M&E team helped in finalizing the \ndesign and data points to monitor on the dashboard. \nCurrently, the dashboard shows data only for States that \nuse AB PM-JAY IT system and the packages in which STG \nhave been launched. The SHAs have also been given \naccess to this dashboard through their State specific \ndashboard IDs. An orientation training of SHAs and their \nteams was conducted online before the dashboard was \nmade live in December 2020.\nMoving forward, the States using their own IT software \n(some of the Brown field States) have been requested to \nhave the STGs integrated in their State specific IT system \nto have uniform implementation across the country. STG \ndashboard \nis \nopen \nto \nStates \nfor \ncontinuous \nself-monitoring at their level. NAFU team also utilises the \ninputs from this dashboard as triggers to monitor flagged \ncases by either desk audit/field audit. The idea is to \ninfuse not only efficient adoption of STGs but also to set \nexemplary patterns for inclusion of modern technologies \n(IT platform for recording and monitoring, Artificial \nIntelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)) for delivering \nbetter quality health care and providing better insights to \npolicy recommendations.\n21",

Analysis of \nresponses help in realizing the areas of training \nneeds or relaxation of mandatory document based on \nlevel of care. It will also help in identifying gaps in \npackage \ndesign, \nrenaming, \nand \ninfrastructural \nchallenges highlighted by respondents in case of \ndeviating from the expected answer\nThis data will be utilized to undertake impact evaluation \nstudies on the use of STGs for certain packages in \nselected States/Districts and as evidence/inputs for future \npolicy decisions. \n16. REVISE AND UPDATE\nTo keep abreast with the revision and rationalization of \nAB PM-JAY Health Benefit Packages and the changes in \ntreatment/clinical recommendations, it is imperative that \nStandard treatment guideline development remains a \ncontinuous process. STGs should be updated regularly to \nreflect changes in accepted treatment strategies. If a \nregular schedule for updating the STGs is not used, they \nmight quickly lose their credibility.\nFigure 13: Devised plan for STGs regular review and update\n22",
  "23\n16.1. Implementation/ compliance monitoring\n• \nThe compliance monitoring of STGs is open to  \n \nStates/UTs through STG dashboard. \n• \nNAFU would monitor flagged cases-desk audit/ field \naudit in order to assess the efficacy. \n• \nOther options for cardiology/CTVS/ on cology \nmonitoring are also being planned in consonance \nwith \nthe \ndiscussion \nwith \ncertain \nvolunteering \ninstitutions/organizations \nof \nNational \nrepute \nespecially using recent technological capabilities \nsuch as Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, etc.\n17. CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNT\n17.1. Challenges\n1. \nLimited availability of MoH&FW & DHR-ICMR \nreference documents\n \nICMR had recently released only 53 Standard \nTreatment Workflows (STWs). Similarly, limited \nguidelines \nwere \navailable \nunder \nClinical \nestablishment act/ MoH&FW/state guidelines that \ncould be mapped with AB PM-JAY packages. Some \nof them were old and not updated. Thus, publicly \navailable information/ protocols/ guidelines in \nmany national and international journals were also \nreferred for getting relevant information and \nensuring updated guidelines are shared with experts \nfor their review and approval.  \n2. \nDisease/ Diagnosis to procedure mapping\n \nMost of the STWs/ clinical protocols of ICMR / \nMoH&FW/ NCG were disease/ diagnosis based. \nThese had to be mapped with the procedures under \nAB PM-JAY. Many a times, for developing one STG, \nmultiple procedures and multiple disease-based \nguidelines had to be mapped.\n3. \nNon availability of many experts for timely feedback \nespecially during pandemic\n \nMost of the experts are nationally / internationally \nacclaimed clinicians from some of the most reputed \nmedical hospitals and colleges in the country.\n \nEspecially during the current pandemic and due\nto \ntheir \nengagement \nin \nadditional \ntasks \n/responsibilities, the feedback from experts took a lot \nof time for review and finalization of the documents. \nSpecialty prioritization had to be done based on \navailability of experts. Online discussions and \npersonal follow-up were also done to ensure speedy \nreview by experts. \n4. \nState wise auto-approved and government reserved \npackages\n \nMany \nStates \nhave \ndifferent \npackages \nas \nauto-approved and government reserved in contrast \nto the national master. The STGs for these States had \nto be integrated in IT system accordingly.\n5. \nPilots couldn’t be completed due to limitation on \ntravel due to pandemic\n \nPilots & orientation were conducted in 6 States/UTs \nonly-Assam, Manipur, Kerala, Haryana, Andhra \nPradesh and Chandigarh. Rest of the planned pilots \nhad to be aborted due to the pandemic.\n6. \nLimited implementation in States using their own IT \nsystem\n \nSome States are still using their State specific IT \nplatform which limits the utilization of integrated \nSTGs in these States except for portability cases. A \nseparate orientation was held, and the IT documents \nrequired for customization were shared and followed \nup by sending communications to these States to \nintegrate at the earliest.",
  "7. \nInitial plan for 30 abuse prone and 100 most \nutilized procedures was scaled up to all packages\n \nDevelopment of STGs was conceptualized with an \nintent to develop the guidelines for only 30 most \nabuse prone packages and 100 most utilized \nprocedures. However, this was later extended to all \npackages under HBP2.0 and corresponding HBP1.0 \npackages. The sudden increase in the requirement \nof STGs for all procedures was coupled with limited \ndedicated human resource for undertaking this task \nfor development, review and integration in IT for \nwhich the team was later expanded. \n8. \nPackages \nfor \nmost \nof \nthe \nspecialties \nwere \nnon-rationalized \n \nMany of the specialties where the packages were \nnot rationalized in HBP2.0 and were adopted as it is \nat HBP1.0 rates including duplicacy in some \npackages across specialties. As a result of this some \nof the specialized mandatory investigations required \ncould not be justified in the existing packages rates. \nWhile making STGs it was observed that, the \nnon-rationalized packages of HBP 1.0 duplicating \nespecially across specialties also had different rates.  \nThis also led to issues in mapping procedures as \nwell. These will be addressed in the next revision of \nhealth benefit packages 3 (HBP3.0). Many States are \nstill transitioning to HBP2.0 and STGs had to be \nmapped with non-rationalized packages of HBP1.0.\n17.2. Lessons learnt\n1. \nCustomisation of the available guidelines to match \nthe available on-ground resources\n \nMany guidelines referred for developing STGs had \nlimited information pertaining to aspects like \nminimum infrastructure and qualifications of the \ntreating doctors. Also, at times these were too ideal, \nwhich had to be matched with the on-field \navailability of the resources while striking a \nbalancing between essential and ideal.\n2. \nOnly most essential mandatory documents to be \nincluded for public hospitals\n \nSome relaxation has been given to public hospitals \nfor mandatory documents for each procedure \nconsidering the limited resources available and \npatient load in these hospitals at the time of \npre-authorization. For private hospitals, mandatory \ndocuments have been kept stringent to prevent fraud \nand ensure quality care is given to the beneficiaries.  \n3. \nInterlinkages of different IT modules (TMS with HEM) \n \nInterlinkages within the AB PM-JAY IT modules- TMS \nand HEM are being worked out to ensure that the \npackages are booked and carried out in the hospitals \nhaving minimum required infrastructure and by \ndoctors having minimum required qualifications.\n4. \nDeveloping FAQs, online training sessions and \nmodules for States \n \nDue to the requirements of continuous capacity \nbuilding of hospitals/processing teams due to turn \nover of staff in each State/ district, online training \nvideos and modules have been developed for \nTraining of Trainers (ToTs) for States and hospitals. All \nqueries received during online orientation have been \ntranslated to Frequently asked questions (FAQs) \nwhich are readily available on the AB PM-JAY \nwebsite. With a view to ensure quality care for \nCOVID-19 \ntesting \n& \ntreatment, \nimmediate \ndevelopment of Standard Treatment Guidelines for \nthese packages has also been done. \n5. \nComprehensive rationalisation of all health benefit \npackages\n \nGiven the feedback from experts and other \nstakeholders while developing the STGs, a process to \nrationalize the health benefit packages has been \ninitiated. \n24",
  "25\n18. FUTURE VISION AND ROADMAP\nThe teams involved in formulating comprehensive STGs \nunderstand the necessity of the programme not as a \none-time effort but a continuous process. With this \nobjective, \nempanelment \nof \nhospitals \n(Hospital \nempanelment module (HEM 2.0)) which would be \nempowered to synchronise with the STGs has already \nbegun. The empanelment criteria have been drawn from \nthe guidance documents and the minimum requirements \nfor hospitals to get into this criterion is formulated.\nBased on the inputs received from Experts and States \n(SHAs) an interim revision has been done in HBP 2.0 with \nthe addition of a few more packages (now termed as HBP \n2.1) which is in the process of being integrated so as to \ninclude new packages and procedures for common \ndiseases. \nAfter \nconsulting \nspeciality \nexperts, \nthe \npackages would be finalized and drafted accordingly \nand STGs for the same would be developed.\nThis is indeed an ambitious venture under AB PM-JAY and \nconcerted efforts can make it successful for better \nhealthcare delivery and attain global standardisation.\n18.1. \nWay Forward\nThe trajectory ahead lies to complete integration and \nrelease of remaining STGs. It will be imperative to have \nperiodic orientation and training in States/UTs/EHCPs. \nSystematic review of feedback from States/ hospitals/ \nTPAs & ISA (through States) will go a long way for \nstrengthening of STG implementation. There is also a \nnecessity of monitoring adherence and conducting \nimpact evaluation to these guidelines through data \nanalytics entailing IT platforms on certain specific pack-\nages in selected states. This will help modifications and \nupdating of the STG development process in the\ndue course.\n19. REFERENCES\n1. \nManagement Sciences for Health and World Health \nOrganization. 2007.

  "29\n9. \nIs it mandatory to follow these guidelines?\n \nThis document has been prepared for guidance of \nMEDCO, PROCESSING TEAM and TRANSACTION \nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM of AB PM-JAY for the \nPre-auth and claims of all AB PM-JAY packages. The \nhospitals can also refer to this document so that they \nmay have the insight on how the pre-auth and \nclaims will be processed. However, this document \ndoesn’t provide any guidance on clinical and \ntherapeutic management of patient. In that respect \nthe hospitals and physicians may refer to other \nrelevant material as per the extant professional \nnorms. The decision for admission, discharge, \napproving/ disapproving the case will depend on \nthe decision of the treating doctor, the hospital and \nthe processing team. Ultimately the professional \njudgment of the healthcare professionals should be \nused. Deviations from the guidelines may be \nmonitored and enquired into by experts to check if \nthese were justified or not.\n10. Are there any training documents/ manual \navailable on use of STGs?\n \nYes, the STG presentation and STG IT training \nmanual is available on AB PM-JAY website link: \nhttps://pmjay.gov.in/standard_treatment_guidelines. \nTraining videos and online training module have \nalso been developed and are available at the AB \nPM- JAY website on the above link.\n11.

Bring \nin \nmore \naccountability \nat \nall\nlevels- MEDCO, PPD, CPD\n \ne. Improve quality of care by avoiding unnecessary \ntreatment with focus on appropriateness of care\n \nf. Promote choosing the relevant package as per \nthe patient requirement\n \ng. Prevent fraud and abuse\n12. Will the deployment of STGs have an impact on \na States policy with the insurance company?\n \nSTGs should not have any impact on the policy with \nthe insurance company, since the package rates are \nnot impacted. In fact, it intends to help prevent fraud \nand abuse, improve quality of care of the patients \nand reduce the number of queries raised to the \nhospitals.\n13. Some \nState \nsponsored \nschemes \nare\nimplementing Standard treatment protocols? \nThen what is new in AB PM-JAY STGs?\n \nYes, \nsome \nState \nsponsored \nschemes \nare \nimplementing \nStandard \nTreatment \nprotocols. \nHowever, all those are manually being referred so \nfar. Under AB PM-JAY, STGs have been integrated in \nthe IT system in the form of mandatory documents, \nquestionnaire. \nMinimum \nqualifications \nof \nthe \ntreating \ndoctor \nand \nminimum \ninfrastructure \nrequirement have also been clarified which will be \nlinked to the empanelment module soon.

  "21.1. Process specific FAQs\n1. \nWhat are the key changes in TMS workflow \nwith the introduction of STGs?\n \na. The guidelines are available for download\n \nb. The \nmandatory \ndocuments \nhave \nbeen \nrationalized\n \nc. A mandatory checklist (in the form of a \nquestionnaire) has been included\n2. \nIs it mandatory to fill the questionnaire or Can \nMEDCO/ PPD/ CPD proceed the case in TMS \nwithout filling the questionnaire?\n \nFilling the questionnaire in the TMS is a mandatory \nstep for raising a pre-auth, initiating claim and \nprocessing a pre-auth and claim for both public and \nprivate hospitals.\n3. \nWhat happens if the answer filled is opposite \nto the expected answer? Will it lead to rejection \nof the case?\n \nIf the answer filled is opposite to the expected \nanswer it will not lead to rejection but the PPD/ CPD \nshould raise a query to the MEDCO in case of any \nconcerns and seek clarification. \n4. \nAre the mandatory documents same for public \nand private hospitals?\n \nYes. For public hospitals, for certain packages, \nrequirement of mandatory documents has been \nreduced. In case SHA decides to make any \ndocument non-mandatory it must intimate, giving \njustification and take concurrence of NHA. \n5. \nWill \nthe \nquestionnaire \ndiffer \nwith \neach \nprocedure?\n \nYes, the questionnaire is different for each \nprocedure. Few questions may be common to all, \nbut most are customized as per the requirement of \nthe procedure.\n \nFor e.g. Barcode for implant is asked only in those \ncases where implant has been used. Similarly, \nspecific investigations are asked for each procedure.\n6. \nAlready some questions are asked at PPD/ CPD \nlevel? How is STG questionnaire different from \nthose existing?\n \nThe questions that were asked so far at the PPD/ \nCPD level were medical audit questions by the \nauditors. The STG questionnaires are for MEDCO, \nPPD and CPD and are integrated in the IT system. \nThe response to these questions may be monitored \nby the auditors. \n7. \nWill the STGs enable introduction of auto query \nfeature for PPD/ CPD?\n \nNo. Currently the auto query feature is not enabled \nfor PPD/ CPD with the introduction of STG.\n8. \nHow does one confirm that they have opened/ \nreferred/ read the STG?\n \nCurrently this feature is not enabled. We hope that \nthe pop up will remind the concerned to open and \nrefer the STGs as this will come for each case of the \nspecific package whenever it is booked/processed. \n9. \nCan the SHA decide to make certain mandatory \ndocuments non-mandatory? \n \nIn case SHA decides to make any document \nnon-mandatory it must intimate, giving justification \nand \ntake \nconcurrence \nof \nNHA. \n(email: \nstg.hnqa@nha.gov.in)\n10. Can a State/ UT opt for using STGs for a few \npackages only as per the requirement of the \nState/ UT? \n \nNo. The STGs for all packages will be integrated in \nthe IT system in a phased manner. States cannot pick \nand choose only for specific packages.\n11. Can a State/ UT do away with STGs for \ngovernment reserved packages?\n \nNo. We are moving towards quality of care across \nboth public and private hospitals and would be \nworking towards standardized approaches. The \npublic hospitals are also paid at par in most states so \naccountability to public funds is uniform across type \nof hospitals to ensure quality of care to beneficiaries. \n30",
  "31\n12. Can the State/ UT start to implement STGs with \nonly private hospitals? \n \nYes if absolutely needed for a short time-frame but \neventually it has to be extended to all hospitals, but \nthe same has to be officially conveyed to NHA with \njustification- \ne-mail: \nstg.hnqa@nha.gov.in \nand \nobtain concurrence.\n13. Some States have changed the mandatory \ndocument requirement for certain packages. \nWhat about uploading mandatory documents \nfor such packages in these States?\n \nThe SHA may share details of such packages \nthrough e-mail: stg.hnqa@nha.gov.in  and the \nreason for their decision to NHA for concurrence. \nHowever, the change will only be made at the State \nlevel if NHA approves and not at the national level. \nFor portability cases the national mandatory \ndocuments will still continue to be applicable.\n \n14. Are these STGs also applicable to those States \nwho are using their own IT software (other than \nNTMS)?\n \nThe adoption of STGs by all States/UTs is \nmandatory. NHA recommends that all SHAs migrate \nto IT system developed and maintained by the NHA. \nTill this is done, the States which are using their own \nIT software are encouraged to adopt these in their \nsystem as well, at the earliest. NHA has initiated \ntime-bound facilitation of this process. However, for \nportability cases for specific packages it will be \napplicable as and when they are integrated\nin NTMS.\n15. What are the implications for non-compliance?\n \nIt is mandatory to upload the mandatory documents \nand fill the questionnaire. The steps have to be \nfollowed to initiate the pre-auth, discharge or \nprocess the case. It will lead to accountability on the \nperson filling the questionnaire. If the answer filled \nin is opposite of the expected answer without due \njustification may lead to raising a query by the PPD/ \nCPD. The monitoring of adherence to STGs\n \nwill also be done at the national level by NHA and \nnecessary directions to concerned states/hospitals \nwill also be issued as and when any major deviations \nare noticed.\n16. Mandatory documents were required earlier \nalso. Then what is the change after the \nintroduction of STGs?\n \nMandatory documents have been rationalized with \nthe introduction of STGs.\n17. Can the PPD/ CPD reject a case if the mandatory \ndocument hasn’t been uploaded/ a wrong \ndocument has been uploaded?\n \nPPD/ CPD must raise a query in such a case and \nclarify from the hospital and then follow the rejection \nprocess as established by the States/ National Health \nauthority under Claims Adjudication. The claims \nadjudication \nmanual \nis \navailable \nat \nhttps://pmjay.gov.in/resources/documents \n(under \nClaim Adjudication)\n18. Will there be an autogenerated standard \nremark of the case being rejected if the \nrelevant mandatory document is not uploaded?\n \nNo such remark will be generated. The PPD/ CPD \nmust raise a query in such a case and clarify from the \nhospital. If even after such query, the document is \nnot submitted in 7 days, the claim may be rejected.",
  "19. What is the significance of questionnaire tab?\n \nSelecting the questionnaire tab will open the \nquestionnaire list. It is a check list for hospitals, PPD \nand CPD to confirm that all required documents \nhave been uploaded and checked for necessary \ndetails.\n20. Will there be a warning sign/ pop-up alert for \nMEDCO at the time of blocking any package if \nthere is any mismatch between the package \nbooked and age/ gender of the patient?\n \nThis feature is currently available for gender in TMS \nfor MEDCO as well as PPD & CPD. Further, certain \nquestions for some packages have also been \nincluded in specific STGs to verify this mismatch.\n21. Will the STGs and its questionnaire be \napplicable for Bulk approval at SHA level as \nwell?\n \nThis is not applicable currently for bulk approval by \nSHA. The SHA may use the STGs for further \nguidance in individual cases.\n22. Are STGs available for surgical complications also?\n \nSTGs will be made available only for those surgical \ncomplication package that are available in HBP2.0 \nand corresponding HBP1.0 packages. For e.g. \n‘Excessive bleeding requiring re-exploration’, etc.\n23. How will the PPD questions appear in auto \napproved cases?\n \nFor auto approved cases, the PPD questions will \nappear in CPD questionnaire. \n24. Government reserved packages and auto \napproved packages may vary from State to \nState. What about such cases?\n \nIn such cases the STGs will be deployed as per the \nState specific government reserved and auto \napproved packages.\n32"
