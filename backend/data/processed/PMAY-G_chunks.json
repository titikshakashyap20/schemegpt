  "chen space along with smokeless LPG Stoves through convergence with other schemes of Government that make their lives easier and healthier. PMAY-G is ensuring the upliftment of the socially deprived households by getting them a Pucca house with basic amenities. Construction of a toilet has been made an integral part of the PMAY-G house and a house is to be treated as complete only after toilet is constructed, ensures cleaner & hygienic environment. One of the unique features towards women empowerment under PMAY-G that houses are sanctioned either solely or jointly in name of the women also ensures a sense of security & pride among the woman member of the household, The new FFI for the PMAY-G will take this noble work forward contributing to better houses, greater resilience and even greater empowerment of Women.

  "16. The programme is driven by the broad objective of providing “Housing for All” in rural areas by March 2024. It is a social welfare program through which the Government provides financial assistance to beneficiaries identified using SECC 2011 and Awaas+ 2018 data to help them construct a house of respectable quality for their personal living. On the requests of various States/Union Territories to cover the left out beneficiaries, the Ministry conducted Awaas+ survey in the year 2018-2019 to identify such households who though eligible, could not find a place in the Permanent Wait List of PMAY-G to achieve the target of construction of 2.95 crore houses under PMAY-G. To keep moving in the right direction and achieving the desired outcomes, it is necessary to redefine the governance structure and introduce innovations.

In the revised framework for implementation of PMAY-G, the Ministry has tried to lay down the standard procedure to deal with difficult cases viz. beneficiaries unwilling to construct the house, death of beneficiaries, permanent or temporary migration of beneficiaries, landlessness, etc. Efforts have also been made to introduce data visualization and analytics for performance monitoring using various dashboards.

  "i Executive Summary 1. Public housing programme in the country started with the rehabilitation of refugees immediately after independence and since then, it has been a major focus area of the Government as an instrument of poverty alleviation. Rural housing program, as an independent programme, started with Indira AwaasYojana (IAY) in January 1996. Although IAY addressed the housing needs in the rural areas, certain gaps were identified during the concurrent evaluations and the Performance Audit by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India in 2014. These gaps, i.e. non-assessment of housing shortage, lack of transparency in selection of beneficiaries, low quality of house and lack of technical supervision, lack of convergence, loans not availed by beneficiaries and weak mechanism for monitoring, were limiting the impact and outcomes of the programme. 2. Government has committed to p",

To fulfil the Government’s commitment and address rural housing gaps, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) is being implemented w.e.f. 1st April, 2016. 3. PMAY-G aims to provide pucca houses with basic amenities to all eligible houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated house in rural areas by 2024. To achieve the objective of “Housing for All” the target number of houses to be constructed by the year 2023-24, is 2.95 Crore. In the first phase, 1.00 crore houses were taken up for construction in 3 years, i.e., 2016-17 to 2018-19.

The unit assistance has been increased from Rs. 70,000 to Rs. 1.20 lakh in plains and from Rs 75,000 to Rs.1.30 lakh in Hillstates/UTs of J&K and Ladakh, North Eastern States, difficult areas and IAP/worst affected Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) districts. The beneficiary is entitled to 90/95 person days of unskilled labour from MGNREGS. The assistance for construction of toilet shall be leveraged through convergence with SBM-G, MGNREGS or any other dedicated source of funding.

From the annual provision of funds for PMAY-G, 95% of funds are earmarked for construction of new houses. This includes 2% allocation towards administrative funds for administering the scheme at the Central and State level. However, any changes in the administrative funds would be notified by the Ministry.For Special Projects, 5% of the total funds would be retained at the Central Level as reserve fund. The annual financial allocation to the states is to be based on the Annual Action Plan (AAP) approved by the Empowered Committee and the funds to States / UTs is to be released in two equal installments. 5.

To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, PMAY-G, selects beneficiaries using housing deprivation parameters in the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011 data which is to be verified by the Gram Sabhas. The SECC data captures specific deprivation related to housing among households. Using the data households that are houseless and living in 0, 1 and 2 kutcha wall and kutcha roof houses can be segregated and targeted. The Permanent Wait List so generated also ensures that the states have ready list of households to be covered under the scheme (through Annual Select Lists) leading to better planning of implementation.

The Awaas+ survey was conducted during January 2018- March 2019 and the details of the potential households captured using the mobile application would be verified and validated and the final list of households prepared thereafter could be included in the Permanent Wait List. 7.

  "1 CHAPTER – 1 HISTORY OF RURAL HOUSING PROGRAMME IN INDIA 1.1 Public housing programme in the country started with the rehabilitation of refugees immediately after independence. Till the year 1960, nearly 5 lakh families were provided houses in different parts of India. 1.2 In 1957, as a part of the Community Development Movement (CDM) a Village Housing Programme (VHP) was introduced providing loans to individuals and cooperatives, of up to Rs.5,000/- per unit. Only 67,000 houses could be constructed in this scheme till the end of the 5th Five Year Plan (1974-1979). Another scheme introduced in the 4th Five Year Plan (1969-1974), called the House Sites-cum-Construction Assistance Scheme (HSCAS), was also transferred to the State Sector from 1974-75. 1.3 Specific focus on rural housing in India, has its origin in the wage employment programmes of National Rural Employment Programme (NREP ",
  " 1974-75. 1.3 Specific focus on rural housing in India, has its origin in the wage employment programmes of National Rural Employment Programme (NREP -1980), and Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme (RLEGP- 1983), by allowing construction of houses under these programmes for SCs/STs and freed bonded labourers. A full-fledged rural housing program Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) was later launched in June, 1985 as a sub-scheme of RLEGP, with earmarking of funds, for the construction of houses for SCs/STs and freed bonded labourers. When Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY) was launched in April, 1989, 6% of the funds were allocated to housing for SCs/STs and freed bonded labourers. In 1993-94, the coverage was extended to Non-SC/ST families, by increasing the earmarked fund for housing under JRY to 10%.

  "42 CHAPTER – 9 REPORTING AND MONITORING 9.0 A robust monitoring mechanism has been adopted to monitor performance as well as the processes under PMAY-G. Performance monitoring is done through real time capture of progress using workflow enabled transactional data in AwaasSoft. The data generated from the transactions in AwaasSoft are collated as system generated reports for monitoring different parameters of performance. Further, Ministry of Rural Development has developed Performance Index Dashboard to monitor the performance of the States / UTs, Districts, Blocks and Panchayats on different pre-determined parameters and nationally rank the States, Districts and Blocks accordingly. This has been done to facilitate continuous monitoring of progress, both on the selected parameters and also geographically, while ensuring healthy competition among the states. Additionally, for process moni",

  "76 CHAPTER 14 GREENING PMAY-G 14.1 The Vision Greening of PMAY-G aims at contributing towards a cleaner and healthier India. PMAY-G encourages adoption of, as far as possible, green designs and technologies, appropriate to the local culture and geo- climatic conditions (including multi-hazards), use of local material minimising carbon foot print and that the houses are comfortable. It also aims at adding to local job creation,. It is envisaged that the green PMAY-G designs and technologies will influence rural housing in general and enable rural India to emerge with sustainable housing with green and disaster resilient features in the future. The states may take steps to encourage willing beneficiaries to adopt green technologies. Figure 14.1: Green Housing in PMAY-G",

Green buildings preserve precious natural resources and improve the quality of life of the people. Below are some of the benefits of green buildings – a) Environmental benefits: Green building is resource-efficient throughout its lifecycle from siting, design, construction, occupancy, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. It optimizes the use of natural resources, energy, water, and materials. It promotes renewable energy such as solar energy, reduces pollution and waste, enables re-use and recycling of the resources. b) Economic benefits: In green buildings, the operational cost on lighting, ventilation, cooling / heating etc. are reduced significantly. c) Improves occupants’ produc",

  "78 compressed stabilized earth block, renewable material such as bamboo, etc. 14.4.3 Alternative technologies can be used to achieve greenness by reducing consumption of high emission and energy-intensive materials. For example, if one uses 230 mm thick rat trap bonded brick wall instead of 230mm thick solid brick wall; about 20% bricks and 25% cement could be saved with an added advantage of increased indoor thermal comfort and enhanced employment opportunity. 14.4.4 For any particular region there will be only a few appropriate green materials and technologies and it will not be difficult to identify and implement the same through trained local construction workers of the region.

  "1. Background 1.1. Need for Awaas+ Survey Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana — Gramin (PMAY-G) was launched with an objective of construction of 2.95 crore houses in the rural areas by March 2022. The scheme is being implemented in 2 phases -Phase-I (2016-17 to 2018-19) and Phase-II (2019-20 to 2021-22). The selection of beneficiaries under PMAY-G has been done based on the housing deprivation parameters included in the Socio-Economic Caste Census - 2011, followed by validation by the Gram Sabha. Although the Permanent Wait List of (PWL) was prepared after following the prescribed procedure, still many States/UTs had reported exclusion errors implying that certain households though eligible, could not find place in the PWL of PMAY-G, owing to various reasons. Therefore, an exercise to identify such households was initiated through the States / UTs using Mobile Application “Awaas+”. Data from ar",

Data from around3.57 crore households have been captured during this exercise. Target Allocation from System 2.1. Introduction In order to explore the algorithms to conduct Awaas+ data analysis, an Expert Committee consisting of stakeholders from Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), National Informatics Centre (NIC), Centre for Data Analytics (CEDA), MoRD and other Page 4 of 16 129",
  "agencies was constituted, under the Chairpersonship of Dr. Nagesh Singh, Former Additional Secretary (MoRD). Target allocation at GP level as per recommendation from this committee was done using proportion of MGNREGA person-days generated. However, several states raised their concerns regarding usage of MGNREGA man-days as the sole indicator for target distribution. The man-days generated may also reflect the administrative efficiency and work demand in a GP and alone is not sufficient for target allocation GP wise. Therefore, a new Expert Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri Pravin Srivastava, Former Secretary, Ministry of Statistics and Programme implementationwas formed with below key objectives: (i) To examine the proposals of the State Governments for de-linking of MGNREGA persons for allocation of Awaas+ Targets (ii) Allocation of targets up to GP (iii) Priority list generatio",

Cumulative Z Scores of these parameters is then calculated. This is then multiplied in the proportion of eligible Awaas+ registrations to the total rural households in that GP. Awaas+ state allocations are divided in this ratio comprising of Z score and proportion of Awaas+ registrations. Target allocated at various levels can be viewed in the reports. 1.

Methodology for Target Re-Shuffle It is to be noted that the States/UTs will remand the ineligible beneficiaries. After remand of ineligible beneficiaries, there may be a scenario wherein the available beneficiaries’ category wise may be less than the target allocated. Moreover, there may also be cases wherein beneficiaries’ category wise may be more than the target allocated. Therefore, the surplus/deficit target will be re-distributed amongst the GPs. The surplus target will be available in the state pool. It is to be noted that the target in the state pool will be maintained category wise. Page 7 of 16",

First time target re-shuffle button will be available to distribute target deficiency due to rounding off done to arrive at whole number for target allocation. Priority List Generation 3.1. Pre-prioritization/Eligibility Criteria Before generating the priority list, pre-prioritization exercise is done to find list of eligible beneficiaries. In this exclusion and inclusion criteria is applied as per SECC 2011. Further, de-duplication is done from AwaasSoft using Aadhaar number. A.

  "3.2. Prioritization Methodology As per the recommendations of Shri Nagesh Singh Committee, Awaas+ priority list is generated using combination of three parameters. Three parameters namely family size, maximum age in family and mandays worked under MGNREGA are used for assigning priority to the beneficiaries. In case Z Scores have same value, same rank is given to such cases and a tie breaker mechanism as mentioned in Step 5 will be used for assigning unique ranks. Steps followed for prioritization are as given below: Step 1. Z Scores are calculated for parameters - family size, maximum age in family and mandays worked under MGNREGA Z value = (Xi-Mean)/SD Where Xi denotes the individual value of a parameter. Mean denotes the sum of all values under the selected parameter divided by the number of values. SD denotes Standard Deviation. Step 2. Total Z Score is calculated by adding Z Scores ",
  "s under the selected parameter divided by the number of values. SD denotes Standard Deviation. Step 2. Total Z Score is calculated by adding Z Scores of these parameters Step 3. The Z Score obtained in Step 2 is translated in a rank to assign priority to each beneficiary. Separate priority lists will be generated for SC, ST, Others and Minorities for each Gram Panchayat / Village Sabha or lowest unit of local self- government. Priority list generated as per Shri Nagesh Singh Committee is taken as the base. Further, prioritization is based on methodology mentioned in FFI. Step 4. Prioritization in each category SC/ST, Minorities and Others is done on houselessness. Households with zero, one and two rooms are arranged in this order such that HH zero rooms are given higher priority. Step 5. Deprivation score is used as a tiebreaker for resolving ties across the ranks which have the same ran",
