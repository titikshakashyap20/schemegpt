MESSAGE

Nearly 72% of Out of Pocket expenditure on health is on account of Primary Care.
Comprehensive primary care reduces mortality and morbidity at much lower costs and
significantly reduces the need for secondary and tertiary care.

The announcement of Ayushman Bharat with its twin pillars of Health and Wellness
Centres for provision of comprehensive primary healthcare and the Pradhan Mantri
Jan Arogya Yojana represents a paradigm shift in that it looks at health holistically and
lays significant milestone towards India’s path to Universal Health Coverage (UHC).
The Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) are envisaged to deliver an expanded range
of primary healthcare services which address the basic primary healthcare needs of
the entire population in their area thus expanding access, universality and equity in
service delivery. An equally important mandate of the Health and Wellness Centre is
to ensure an increased focus on health prevention and promotion, so that good health
and wellness becomes a Jan Andolan and ushers in collective responsibility and care.
These Centres should become facilitators and platform for all wellness activities
including yoga in the community.

The Health and Wellness Centres are expected to harness the potential and benefits
of technology for improved service delivery, capacity building and reporting in the
healthcare sector. The effective delivery of universal Comprehensive Primary Health
Care will directly and positively impact the other pillar of Ayushman Bharat through
the decongestion of secondary care facilities and reduction of healthcare costs.

The journey to strengthen the Health and Wellness Centres is a learning process,
building on a shared vision of universal coverage and access. | expect that these
guidelines will evolve as we go forward, building on state and district experiences, so
that the Health and Wellness Centres herald significant improvements in health
outcomes.

MESSAGE 7

The National Health Policy, 2017 set the vision and the tone for achieving universal
Health coverage. One of the policy shifts is the strong advocacy for movement from
selective primary care to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals

As countries commemorate forty years of the Alma Ata declaration, 1978 that
identified primary health care as the key to the attainment of the goal of Health for All,
the announcement of Ayushman Bharat with Health and Wellness centres as its
strategic component for provision of comprehensive primary health care represents our
commitment towards Universal Health coverage.

The Health and Wellness Centres will be a game changer to increase health system
responsiveness to people by bringing services closer to communities, and being able to
address the needs of most marginalized, through the Primary Health Care team.

The Operational Guidelines are intended to facilitate states and districts to convert this
policy announcement into implementation. Preventive and promotive care as a core
component of Wellness and wellbeing are concepts we must imbibe in our quest for
Universal Health Coverage.

I am happy to note that these guidelines set out, in simple terms, the contours for
implementation. I urge the States to use these guidelines as a framework to move

expeditiously towards transforming the existing sub health centres and primary health
centres to Health and Wellness Centres.

MESSAGE

The announcement of Ayushman Bharat marks a translational shift in
prioritising policies and programmes towards achieving Universal Health Coverage.

Health and Wellness Centres, which represents the base pillar of Ayushman
Bharat, are envisaged to deliver an expanded range of services to address the basic
primary health care needs of the entire population in their area, rather than focus
selectively on population sub-groups, thus expanding access, universality and equity
close to community. The emphasis on health prevention and promotion is designed
to bring focus on keeping people healthy by engaging and empowering individuals
and communities to choose healthy behaviours and make changes that reduce the
risk of developing chronic diseases and other morbidities.

Many components of the Health and Wellness Centres are new and will
involve a paradigm shift at several levels. I am sure that these operational Guidelines
for Comprehensive primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centres will
provide guidance and smoothen the process of implementation challenges.

My sincere hope is that States take strong ownership of the programme and
leverage the central support to scale up and expand the scope of Health and Wellness
Centres.

MESSAGE
The Operational Guidelines for the delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health Care
through Health and Wellness Centres are intended as a framework document for
states and districts as they build upon the platform created by the National Health
Mission, to enable integrated delivery of vertical programmes and address all
population sub groups.

The guidelines in their final form have benefited enormously from wide ranging
consultations with state policy makers and implementers as well as other
stakeholders, eminent public health experts and civil society organizations. The
guidelines also integrate lessons and experiences from early pilots in some states.

The guidelines clearly express the key features of Comprehensive Primary Health
Care, namely integrated and quality health care services maintaining the continuum
of people centric service delivery.

| am happy to note that the Operational Guidelines are comprehensive and provide
details on strategic approaches to implement the multiple work streams and at the
same time ensure flexibility to be adapted in various contexts and scenarios, within
and across states.

While there is no one size fits all approach, there must be a shared understanding of
the basic principles and design features of the Health and Wellness Centres. | hope
that these guidelines are discussed and disseminated at the level of the state and also
in the districts. We also look forward to the feedback of the states based on their
experiences so that the guidelines may be kept abreast.

Delivering comprehensive primary health care through Health and Wellness Centres
is a key component of Ayushman Bharat and | urge all states to institutionalize the
policy and the necessary institutional and governance reforms for building a robust
health system to anchor the Health and Wellness Centres. Let the Centers become a
hub of activities for a healthy India.

MESSAGE
The launch of these Operational Guidelines for Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health
and Wellness Centres marks a major milestone in the history of public health in India. They are based
on the premise of an effective health systems, acknowledging the changing disease burden and it also
includes interventions that account for high proportions of morbidity and mortality leveraging a slew of
programmes launched in the past few years to reduce out of pocket expenditures.
The operational guidelines are comprehensive and draw on the lessons of the National Health Mission
in various contexts. They are ambitious in their scope and scale and include guidance on physical and
financial requirements, service packages, IT requirements, monitorable targets and also suggest reforms
in payment packages including team-based incentives.
The delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health Care is not without challenges, since it involves a paradigm
shift at all levels of the health system. The NHM has paved the way for effective implementation of HWC,
and states must leverage this learning for effective implementation of HWC.
The guidelines, albeit very comprehensive, are a road-map, and states will need to adapt these to their
contexts. However, I do hope that states will use the guidelines to develop a state specific road map, and
build shared accountability at district and sub district level, so that there is a clear goal and focus to help
us reach the target of operationalizing 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres.
The Operational Guidelines are based on inputs from states which have been valuable in strengthening
these guidelines. I would also like to thank the team at the National Health Systems Resource Centre,
experts and state government officials whose relentless efforts have made the launch of these guidelines
possible.

The National Health Mission (NHM), the country’s flagship health systems strengthening programme,
particularly for primary and secondary health care envisages “attainment of universal access to equitable,
affordable and quality health care which is accountable and responsive to the needs of people”. Investments
during the life of the NHM in its earlier phases were targeted to strengthen Reproductive and Child Health
(RCH) services and contain the increasing burden of communicable diseases such as Tuberculosis, HIV/
AIDS and vector borne diseases. While such a focus on selective primary health care interventions, enabled
improvements in key indicators related to RCH and select communicable diseases, the range of services
delivered at the primary care level did not consider increasing disease burden and rising costs of care on
account of chronic diseases.
Studies show that 11.5% households in rural areas and about only 4% in urban areas, reported seeking any
form of OPD care - at or below the CHC level (except for childbirth) primary care facilities, indicating low
utilization of the public health systems for other common ailments1. National Sample Survey estimates for
the period-2004 to 2014 show a 10% increase in households facing catastrophic healthcare expenditures.
This could be attributed to the fact that private sector remains the major provider of health services in
the country and caters to over 75% and 62% of outpatient and in-patient care respectively. India is also
witnessing an epidemiological and demographic transition, where non-communicable diseases such as
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, respiratory, and other chronic diseases, account for over 60% of
total mortality.2
There is global evidence that Primary Health Care is critical to improving health outcomes. It has an important
role in the primary and secondary prevention of several disease conditions, including non-communicable
diseases. The provision of Comprehensive Primary Health Care reduces morbidity and mortality at much
lower costs and significantly reduces the need for secondary and tertiary care. For primary health care to be
comprehensive, it needs to span preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative aspects of care.
Primary Health Care goes beyond first contact care, and is expected to mediate a two-way referral support
to higher-level facilities (from first level care provider through specialist care and back) and ensure follow up
support for individual and population health interventions.
In India, the need for and emphasis on strengthening Primary Health Care was firstly articulated in the Bhore
Committee Report 1946 and subsequently in the First and Second National Health Policy statements (1983

Implementation, Government of India

and 2002). India is also a signatory to the Alma Ata declaration for Health for All in 1978. The Twelfth Five
Year Plan Identified Universal Health Coverage as a key goal and based on the recommendations of the
High- Level Expert Group Report on UHC had called for 70% budgetary allocation to Primary Health Care in
pursuit of UHC for India.
The National Health Policy, 2017 recommended strengthening the delivery of Primary Health Care, through
establishment of “Health and Wellness Centres” as the platform to deliver Comprehensive Primary Health
Care and called for a commitment of two thirds of the health budget to primary health care.
In February 2018, the Government of India announced that 1,50,000 Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs)
would be created by transforming existing Sub Health Centres and Primary Health Centres to deliver
Comprehensive Primary Health Care and declared this as one of the two components of Ayushman Bharat.
This was the first step in the conversion of policy articulations to a budgetary commitment.
The Report of the Primary Health Care Task Force, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of
India while reiterating that primary health care is the only affordable and effective path for India to Universal
Health Coverage, also provided valuable insights into structure and processes that are required in health
systems to enable Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC).
The delivery of CPHC through HWCs rests substantially on the institutional mechanisms, governance
structures, and systems created under the National Health Mission (NHM). NHM, as part of health system
reform in the country, in its nearly 12 years of implementation, has supported states to create several
platforms for delivery of community-based health systems, expanding Human Resources for Health and
infrastructure towards strengthening primary and secondary care. Though largely limited to a few conditions,
NHM created mechanisms for expanded coverage and reach, and developed systems for improved delivery
of medicines, diagnostics and improved reporting. About five years ago, these components were also
introduced in urban areas.
Thus, although the delivery of universal Comprehensive Primary Health Care, through HWCs builds on
existing systems, it will need change management and systems design at various levels, to realise its full
potential. The other component of Ayushman Bharat, namely the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY)
aims to provide financial protection for secondary and tertiary care to about 40% of India’s households.
Its success and affordability rests substantially on the effectiveness of provision of Comprehensive Primary
Health Care through HWCs. Together, the two components of Ayushman Bharat will enable the realization
of the aspiration for Universal Health Coverage.
1.1. About the Guidelines
These guidelines were developed after consultation with policy makers and practitioners at national and
state level and with technical experts. It also draws on implementation experiences of government, NGO and
private sector in the delivery of Primary Health Care. These guidelines are intended to serve as a framework
for operationalizing the multiple components required for the delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health
Care services through the Health & Wellness Centres. These guidelines are expected to support programme
managers at state and district levels in rolling out Comprehensive Primary Health Care. They provide an
overview of the systems requirements and strategies for change management to deliver CPHC.
The use of these guidelines would enable the states to put in place the necessary design elements and sub-
systems required for Health and Wellness Centres to be created and deliver the health services expected of
them. However, states have the flexibility to make necessary modifications based on their specific needs and
capacities. The implementation of Comprehensive Primary Health Care would require substantial change
management in processes for planning, service delivery, monitoring and financing and will require the
active participation of several stakeholders including civil society, NGOs, academic and research agencies,
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

development partners, the private sector and, most importantly, the community. Operationalizing HWCs will
be incremental in nature with contextual variations in models and processes evolving in different states.
These guidelines do not cover grounds included in several other guidelines already issued but highlight
areas in which transformation and change management is needed, besides clarifying key concepts related
to Comprehensive Primary Health Care and Health and Wellness Centres.
These guidelines are envisaged to be reviewed periodically and revised based on implementation
lessons from the field so that they continue to provide meaningful and updated guidance to programme
implementers and inform policy adaptation and modification.

In order to ensure delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) services, existing Sub Health
Centres covering a population of 3000-5000 would be converted to Health and Wellness Centres (HWC),
with the principle being “time to care” to be no more than 30 minutes. Primary Health Centres in rural and
urban areas would also be converted to HWCs. Such care could also be provided/ complemented through
Box 2.1. Key Principles
1. Transform existing Sub Health Centres and Primary Health Centres to Health and Wellness Centers to ensure
universal access to an expanded range of Comprehensive Primary Health Care services.
2. Ensure a people centered, holistic, equity sensitive response to people’s health needs through a process of
population empanelment, regular home and community interactions and people’s participation.
3. Enable delivery of high quality care that spans health risks and disease conditions through a commensurate
expansion in availability of medicines & diagnostics, use of standard treatment and referral protocols and
advanced technologies including IT systems.
4. Instil the culture of a team-based approach to delivery of quality health care encompassing: preventive,
promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative care.
5. Ensure continuity of care with a two way referral system and follow up support.
6. Emphasize health promotion (including through school education and individual centric awareness) and
promote public health action through active engagement and capacity building of community platforms and
individual volunteers.
7. Implement appropriate mechanisms for flexible financing, including performance-based incentives and
responsive resource allocations.
8. Enable the integration of Yoga and AYUSH as appropriate to people’s needs.
9. Facilitate the use of appropriate technology for improving access to health care advice and treatment initiation,
enable reporting and recording, eventually progressing to electronic records for individuals and families.
10. Institutionalize participation of civil society for social accountability.
11. Partner with not for profit agencies and private sector for gap filling in a range of primary health care functions.
12. Facilitate systematic learning and sharing to enable feedback, and improvements and identify innovations for
scale up.
13. Develop strong measurement systems to build accountability for improved performance on measures that
matter to people.

outreach services, Mobile Medical Units, health camps, home visits and community-based interaction,
but the principle should be a seamless continuum of care that ensures the principles of equity, quality,
universality and no financial hardship.
The HWC at the sub health centre level would be equipped and staffed by an appropriately trained Primary
Health Care team, comprising of Multi-Purpose Workers (male and female) & ASHAs and led by a Mid-Level Health
Provider (MLHP). Together they will deliver an expanded range of services. In some states, sub health centres have
earlier been upgraded to Additional PHCs. Such Additional PHCs will also be transformed to HWCs.
A Primary Health Centre (PHC) that is linked to a cluster of HWCs would serve as the first point of referral for
many disease conditions for the HWCs in its jurisdiction. In addition, it would also be strengthened as a HWC
to deliver the expanded range of primary care services.
The Medical Officer at the PHC would be responsible for ensuring that CPHC services are delivered through
all HWCs in her/his area and through the PHC itself. The number and qualifications of staff at the PHC would
continue as defined in the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).
For PHCs to be strengthened to HWCs, support for training of PHC staff (Medical Officers, Staff Nurses,
Pharmacist, and Lab Technicians), and provision of equipment for “Wellness Room”, the necessary IT
infrastructure and the resources required for upgrading laboratory and diagnostic support to complement
the expanded ranges of services would be provided. States could choose to modify staffing at HWC and
PHC, based on local needs.
The HWC would deliver an expanded range of services (Box 2.2). These services would be delivered at both
SHCs and in the PHCs, which are transformed as HWCs. The level of complexity of care of services delivered
at the PHC would be higher than at the sub health centre level and this would be indicated in the care
pathways and standard treatment guidelines that will be issued periodically.
Box 2.2: Expanded Range of Services
1. Care in pregnancy and child-birth.
2. Neonatal and infant health care services.
3. Childhood and adolescent health care services.
4. Family planning, Contraceptive services and other Reproductive Health Care services.
5. Management of Communicable diseases including National Health Programmes.
6. Management of Common Communicable Diseases and Outpatient care for acute simple illnesses and minor
ailments.
7. Screening, Prevention, Control and Management of Non-Communicable diseases.
8. Care for Common Ophthalmic and ENT problems.
9. Basic Oral health care.
10. Elderly and Palliative health care services.
11. Emergency Medical Services.
12. Screening and Basic management of Mental health ailments.
In many states, the Primary Health Centre would serve as the first point of referral and administrative hub
for sub health centres. However, in certain states, the sub health centre is linked directly to the Community
Health Centre (CHC) at the block level (which in some blocks is a role performed by the Block PHC). Across
all contexts however, it must be ensured that administrative, technical/mentoring and referral support be
provided by a MBBS Medical Officer in a facility that is in geographic proximity to the cluster of HWCs and is
equipped to manage referral support for HWC. This could therefore be either a PHC or a CHC.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

7
Similarly, in the urban context, the Urban Primary Health Centres or Urban Health Posts, where they exist,
would be strengthened as HWCs to deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care. The norm of One MPW-
(F) per 10,000 population supported by four to five ASHAs, will enable outreach services, preventive and
promotive care and home and community-based services. Therefore, in the urban context, the team of MPWs
(F) and ASHAs would be considered equivalent to a front-line provider team with the first point of referral
being the UPHC catering to about at 50,000 population. All the key principles of HWCs indicated above will be
applicable to PHCs in urban areas. Initial action for upgrading UPHCs to HWCs would require capacity building
of staff and field functionaries in the expanded range of services. Population enumeration, empanelment,
disease screening would also be required. In many cities, where specialists’ consultation is currently being
made available through evening OPDs on pre-fixed days, these could be leveraged as a strategy for ensuring
continuity of care. However, states are free to undertake modifications that best fit their contexts.
In planning for HWCs, states need to pay close attention to improving geographic accessibility, ensure the
full complement of staff at each level, enable regular capacity building and supportive supervision, ensure
uninterrupted supply of medicines and diagnostics, and maintain a continuum of care seamlessly linking
people to various levels of care so that the services offered at the primary health care level fully meet the
promise of expanded range and commensurate outcomes.
Figure 2.1: Key Elements of HWC
As the principle of HWC is that they provide a continuum of care for all illnesses in the community, strategic
modifications of components of health systems at secondary and tertiary levels and re-organization of
workflow processes would be needed in parallel to effectively implement Comprehensive Primary Health
Care through HWCs.
Clear demarcation of services that are provided in the Community, HWC and PHC/CHC levels is difficult.
Services provided at the primary health care level, are in fact, a shifting goal post, affected by a range of factors.
However, this initiative under Ayushman Bharat, proposes to use diagnostic and technological innovation to
bring services as close to people and communities as possible. We need to recognize that poor service delivery
at HWC will, adversely impact the gate-keeping role and push patients unnecessarily into costlier secondary
and tertiary care facilities. It could also result in pushing patients to the private sector with adverse implications
for out of pocket expenditure and impoverishment. Figure 2.1 illustrates the key elements of HWC.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

2.2. Inputs for Health Wellness Centres
The key inputs to be provided at a HWC are listed below:
2.2.1 Primary health care team to deliver the expanded range of services.
a. at the upgraded ShC – A team of at least three service providers (one Mid-level provider, at least
two (preferably three) Multi-Purpose Workers – two female and one male, and team of ASHAs at the
norm of one per 1000.
b. at the strengthened PhC – PHC team as per IPHS standards. Although all the PHCs have been
expected to provide 24*7 nursing care, this has not been possible in several states for variety of
reasons. In 24*7 PHCs having inpatient care, an additional nurse should be posted where cervical
cancer screening is being undertaken/ planned. In PHCs that are not envisaged to provide inpatient
care, the existing nurses should receive modular training in certificate course for primary care.
In urban areas, the team would consist of the MPW- F (for 10,000 population) and the ASHAs
(one per 2500).
2.2.2 logistics – Adequate availability of essential medicines and diagnostics to support the expanded
range of services, to resolve more and refer less at the local levels, and to enable dispensation of
medicines for chronic illnesses as close to communities as possible.
2.2.3 infrastructure – Sufficient space for outpatient care, for dispensing medicines, diagnostic services,
adequate spaces for display of communication material of health messages, including audio visual
aids and appropriate community spaces for wellness activities, including the practice of Yoga and
physical exercises.
2.2.4 digitization – HWC team to be equipped with tablets/smart Phones to serve a range of functions
such as: population enumeration and empanelment, record delivery of services, enable quality follow
up, facilitate referral/continuity of care and create an updated individual, family and population health
profile, and generate reports required for monitoring at higher levels.
2.2.5 Use of Telemedicine/iT Platforms – At all levels, teleconsultation would be used to improve referral
advice, seek clarifications, and undertake virtual training including case management support by
specialists.
2.2.6 Capacity Building – Mid Level Health Providers will be trained in a set of primary healthcare and
public health competencies through an accredited training programme that combines theory and
practicum with on the job training. Other service providers at HWC will also be trained appropriately
to deliver the expanded range of services.
2.2.7 health Promotion – Development of health promotion material and facilitation of health promotive
behaviours through engagement of community level collectives such as – Village Health Sanitation
and Nutrition Committee (VHSNCs), Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS) and Self-Help Groups (SHGs), and
creating health ambassadors in schools. Enabling behaviour change communication to address life
style related risk factors and undertaking collective action for reducing risk exposure, improved care
seeking and effective utilization of primary health care services.
2.2.8 Community Mobilization – for action on social and environmental determinants, would require
intersectoral convergence and build on the accountability initiatives under NHM so that there is no
denial of health care and universality and equity are respected.
2.2.9 linkages with Mobile Medical Units – Linkages with Mobile Medical Units (MMU) could serve to
improve access and coverage in remote and underserved areas where there is difficulty in establishing
HWCs. In such cases, medicines and other support could be provided to frontline workers, with
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

periodic MMU visits. MMUs could also be linked to nearby HWCs, where medical consultation could
be arranged on scheduled days, for those unable to travel to referral sites. MMUs could be used in
conjunction with specific service delivery platforms, which otherwise are difficult to operationalize in
that locality. MMUs can be designed to meet the specific needs in that locality, as a supplement to the
HWC network. The visit calendar of the MMUs would need to be planned and displayed at HWC.
2.3. Financing
Suitable payment mechanism for primary health care will need to be explored. Once the systems for
population empanelment and record of services are streamlined, the possibility of financing on a per capita
basis can be explored. In addition, team based incentives would be initiated. This will be done to facilitate
accountability to outputs/outcomes and provide individual centred care.
2.4. Essential Outputs of HWC
2.4.1 The hWC data Base: Population enumeration and empanelment implies the creation and
maintenance of database of all families and individuals in an area served by a HWC. This is planned
such that every individual is empanelled to a HWC. This also involves active communication to make
residents aware of this facility.
2.4.2 health Cards and Family health Folders: These are made for all service users to ensure access to all
health care entitlements and enable continuum of care. The health cards are given to the families and
individuals. The family health folders are kept at the HWC or nearby PHC in paper and/or digital format.
This ensures that every family knows their entitlement to healthcare through both HWC and the
Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana or equivalent health schemes of state and central government.
2.4.3 increased access to Services: HWCs would provide access to an expanded range of services
indicated in Box 2.2. The availability of services would evolve in different states gradually, depending
on three factors- the availability of suitably skilled human resources at the HWC, the capacity at
district/sub-district level to support the HWC in the delivery of that service, and the ability of the
state to ensure uninterrupted supply of medicines and diagnostics at the level of HWC. States will
also have the flexibility to expand the range of service to address local health problems as defined
by disease prevalence.
2.5. Outcomes
2.5.1 improved population coverage: Active empanelment and HWC database will improve the population
coverage. The HWC database would enable HWC staff to monitor and identify the left out population
and improve coverage of national health programmes.
2.5.2 reduced out of pocket expenditure and catastrophic health expenditure: Improved access to
expanded services closer to the community, assured availability of medicines and diagnostic services
and linkages for care coordination with Medical Officers/specialists across levels of care will reduce
financial hardships faced by community.
2.5.3 risk factor mitigation: Health promotion efforts by primary health care team would support in
addressing the risk factors for diseases.
2.5.4 decongestion of secondary and tertiary health facilities: A strong network of HWCs at the sub
district level would facilitate resolving more cases at primary level and reduce overcrowding at
secondary and tertiary facilities for follow up cases as well as serve a gate keeping function to higher-
level facilities.

2.6. Impact
2.6.1 improved population health outcomes: Improved availability, access and utilization will in turn
contribute to equitable health outcomes measured through periodic population based surveys for
key indicators listed in Section 10.1- Monitoring.
2.6.2 increased responsiveness: Provision of care by primary care team will be based on principles of
family led care including dignity and respect for individuals and communities with particular focus on
marginalized, information sharing, encouraging participation, including intersectoral collaboration
that will lead to increased trust building, comfort in access to care and enable addressing social and
environmental determinants.
While not all inputs can be provided immediately, the state needs to have a road map for HWC strengthening,
in which some inputs can be added in an incremental manner. However, addition of the services for chronic
conditions with requisite HR who is trained, and with the medicines and diagnostics would be a critical first
step. The centres which do not fulfil all criteria but have only initiated expanded service delivery, would be
referred to as “HWCs – progressive,” and have a clear time line to become “fully functional HWC”- i.e., with
the entire complement of the primary health care team, and delivery of the expanded range of services,
identified for Comprehensive Primary Health Care.

3.1. Expanded Service Delivery
3.1.1 Population Enumeration and Empanelment of Families at HWC
The Primary Health Care team at the HWC would serve as the fulcrum of Comprehensive Primary Health
Care and support system, for planning, delivery and monitoring services for the defined catchment
population. Once the HWCs have been decided, population enumeration to facilitate empanelment is a
critical first step.
In order to ensure equitable population coverage and to address issues of marginalization, the frontline
workers would create population-based household lists and undertake registration of all individuals and
families residing within the catchment area of a Health and Wellness Centre. It is this registration that is
referred to as empanelment. It is a right of anyone, resident in that area to be enrolled. Care should not be
denied to those who are not enrolled but seek care at the HWC. An active process of enrolment is encouraged
to ensure that there is an active contact between the HWC team and the entitled population.
Empanelment of all individuals to a particular HWC serves several roles. It lays the foundation for trust
between the community and the primary health care team. It declares the HWC as the first port of call for
health for the community that the government is providing. It makes the HWC responsible for the health
of population, and it enables a facilitatory role for access to secondary and tertiary care through its referral
mechanisms and linkages. Finally it also provides follow up support as per the treatment plan provided
by the higher facility. Empanelment of individuals and families would also facilitate monitoring universal
coverage for all programmes viz. Maternal and Child Health, Family Planning, Immunization and chronic
disease screening, long term communicable diseases. It also enables a basis for payment by capitation at a
later stage, which would be most useful for HWCs catering to larger than expected populations.
This is however likely to be a challenge in urban and other areas where population density is high. Population
empanelment, updated at shorter periodic intervals would clarify the geographic and population coverage.
The HWC is responsible for undertaking this, so as to make explicit the population under its care. This makes
it possible for the team to understand the specific needs of population sub-groups, local specific needs, and
enable monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the team including assessment of quality of care
and coverage. Families can choose to be empanelled with one of the many HWCs in urban areas.
Family Health Folders and an individual health records will be created through the ASHAs and the MPWs and
stored in the HWC. A digital format of the family health records will be implemented in a phased manner
depending on the state of readiness for connectivity and resource availability. Population Based Records/
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

Data Base already available should be leveraged to initiate HWC based digital records of demographic
information of individuals.
3. 1.2. Organization of Services
Delivery of an expanded range of services, closer to the community at HWCs would require re-organization
of the existing workflow processes. The delivery of services would be at three levels i.e., i) Family/Household
and community levels, ii) Health and Wellness Centres and iii) and Referral Facilities/Sites. Delivery of services
closer to the community and close monitoring would enable increased coverage and help in addressing
issues of marginalization and exclusion of specific population groups.

3.1.3. Service Delivery Framework
The services envisaged at the HWC level will include early identification, basic management, counselling,
ensuring treatment adherence, follow up care, ensuing continuity of care by appropriate referrals, optimal
home and community follow up, and health promotion and prevention for the expanded range of services.
The primary health care team led by the Mid-level health provider would be trained to provide first level of
management and triage i.e. refer the patient to the appropriate health facility for treatment and follow up.
Care provision at every level would be provided as per clinical pathways and standard treatment guidelines.
This would facilitate the decongestion of the secondary and tertiary care facilities as the primary care
services would be made available at the HWC level closer to the community with adequate referral linkages
and early identification and management will prevent disease progression that would require secondary/
tertiary care interventions. Thus, the HWC team would play the critical role of coordination by assisting
people in navigation of the health system and mobilizing the support for timely access to specialist services
when required.
The HWC would also play an important role in undertaking public health functions in the community
leveraging the frontline workers and community platforms.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

13
The chapter on service delivery outlines the range of services that would be made available at the community
level, at the HWC and at the referral sites to ensure effective delivery of primary care services. Task Forces are
concurrently working on finalizing detailed care pathways for some of the services. These will be circulated to
states as and when they are finalized. For services related to RCH, Communicable Diseases and five common
Non-Communicable Diseases such care, pathways and Standard Treatment Guidelines are already available.
However, these may require to be updated from time to time.
3.1.4. Continuity of Care and Patient Centric Care
Continuity of care is one of the key tenets of Primary Health Care. Continuum of care spans for the individuals
from the same facility to her/his home and community, and across levels of care- primary, secondary and
tertiary. Care must be ensured from the level of the family through the facility level.
zz Community/household: The ASHA would undertake home visits to ensure that the patient is taking
actions for risk factor modification, provides counselling and support, including reminders for follow
up appointments at HWC and collection of medicines.
zz hWC: Dispensation of medicines, repeat diagnostics as required, identification of complications
and facilitating referrals at a higher-level facility/teleconsultation with a specialist as required are
undertaken at the HWC, including maintenance of records. The last activity would enable HWC
team to identify stable patients, and to organize community level supportive activities to improve
adherence to care protocols and reduction of exposure to risk factors.
z The referring HWC uses a clear referral format to provide information on reason for referral and
care already being provided and other details as necessary (especially on insurance coverage). The
referring HWC also ensures that the appropriate specialists are available in that facility and to the
extent possible, facilitate the referral appointment.
zz higher-level Facility: The referred medical officer or specialists would examine the patient and
develop/modify the treatment plan, including instructions for the patient as well as a note to the
HWC provider, indicating the need for change. Systems need to be in place so that a medicine
prescribed by a specialist is made available to the patient at the HWC where she/he is empanelled.
Periodic meetings (whether in person or through virtual platforms) between HWC team and the
specialists/ medical officers referred to, are also essential to ensure that they all function as one team
and ensure care continuum.
developing referral linkages: In effect, every existing HWC providing the expanded range of services, would
manage the largest proportion of disease conditions and organize referral for consultation and follow up with
an MBBS doctor at the linked Primary Health Centre- HWC, (one per 30,000 population/20000 in hilly areas)
that would also provide a similar set of services as the sub centre HWC, but of a higher order of complexity.
The Block PHCs and CHCs would now need to provide referral services beyond emergency obstetric care, to
include general medical and specialist consultation. Strengthening of health facilities as FRUs and first level of
hospitalization would need to be done in a phased manner based on the availability of infrastructure, equip-
ment and Human Resources for Health at the identified health facilities. For example, cases of acute simple ill-
ness need not be referred to DH/FRU but can be handled at PHC itself. On the other hand, high-risk pregnancy,
sick new born, care for serious mental health ailments may be referred directly to a District Hospital.
Empanelment of population in HWC will facilitate gate keeping, as it will help families in identifying their
closest health facility. Patient centric care, trust building by primary care team, adopting standard treatment
protocols, and assured supply of medicines would facilitate in resolving more cases at the HWC level and
reduce direct seeking of care at secondary level facilities.
ensuring two-way referrals between various facility levels: The delivery of Comprehensive Primary
Health Care particularly for chronic conditions requires periodic specialist referral. Treatment for chronic
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

conditions can be preferably initiated by MO at PHC, in consultation with concerned specialist at secondary/
tertiary care facilities. An IT system/teleconsultation can considerably facilitate this process. The loop
between the primary care medical provider and the specialist must be closed. This can be achieved when
the specialists at district facility or higher are able to communicate to the medical officer of the adequacy
of treatment, any change in treatment plans, and further referral action.
Using Mobile Medical Units to increase access: In order to expand access to services, and reach remote
populations, MMUs would enable an expansion of service delivery and serve the role of enabling the
provision of Comprehensive Primary Health Care and serving to establish continuum of care.

4.1. Mid Level Health Provider
A key addition to the primary health team at the SHC-HWC, would be the Mid-level Health Provider
(MLHP) who would be a Community Health Officer (CHO) - a BSc. in Community Health or a Nurse
(GNM or B.SC) or an Ayurveda practitioner, trained and certified through IGNOU/other State Public
Health/Medical Universities for a set of competencies in delivering public health and primary health
care services.
The rationale for introducing this new cadre of health provider is to:
zz Augment the capacity of the Health and Wellness Centre to offer expanded range of services closer
to community, thus improving access and coverage with a commensurate reduction in OOPE.
zz Improve clinical management, care coordination and ensure continuity of care through regular
follow up, dispensing of medicines, early identification of complications, and undertaking basic
diagnostic tests.
zz Improve public health activities related to preventive and promotive health and the measurement
of health outcomes for the population served by the HWC.
This will improve utilization of health services at primary care level, reduce fragmentation of care, and work
load at secondary and tertiary care facilities. Districts will be encouraged to find MLHPs from within their
district. However, since not all districts may have adequate availability of eligible candidates, it may be
appropriate to plan MLHPs as a State cadre that will adhere to state specific cadre management rules. The
state should make cadre rules and communicate to districts. States could also explore the possibility of
creating a district cadre.
4.1.1 Selection of Mid Level Health Providers for the Health and Wellness Centres
It is important to ensure the following processes for selection of the MLHPs are followed so that candidates
with the right attitude, competencies and motivation to work in rural and remote settings are recruited.
States should especially undertake local selection to maximize retention.
zz Widely published notification that are clear on eligibility norms, job deliverables, selection criteria,
remuneration pattern, date of written test and interview.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

22
zz Transparent short listing of applications.
zz Conduct of written assessment and interviews of the shortlisted candidates to assess competency
of the candidates and willingness to serve in rural remote areas respectively.
zz Finalization of the score sheet and submission of the list of selected candidates to State Health
Mission for ratification.
zz Appointment to posts based on a system of “counselling” where those higher on the final merit list
get to choose first from the posts that are vacant. The district will however retain the right to transfer
them, usually within the district or state, if a need to do so arises.
Recruitment of Mid- Level Health Providers can be undertaken through a state level advertisement that
clearly indicates district wise positions and preference for selection of local candidates. States are free to
select in-service candidates or candidates from the open market. If desirable, states can reserve a proportion
of seats for women candidates. The recruitment process of Mid-Level Health Providers will be state specific
but for ensuring transparency and quality in selection, each state will need to supervise and assist every
district for initial screening of applicants based on the qualifications, followed by a written examination
that the state conducts; with support from any suitable government organization/institutions/public/health
university with expertise in conducting such exams for large scale quality selection of candidates. This should
be followed by interviews to select the most competent candidates.
4.1.2 Roles
The Mid- Level Health Provider would broadly be expected to carry out public health functions,
ambulatory care, management and provide leadership at the HWCs. They would be responsible for the
following:
1. Ensure that all households in the service areas are listed, empanelled and a database is maintained-
in digital format/ paper format as required by the state.
2. Provide clinical care as specified in the care pathways and standard treatment guidelines for the
range of services expected of the HWC.
3. Clinical care provision would include coordinating for care/ case management for chronic
illnesses based on the diagnosis and treatment plan made by the Medical Officer/specialists
who will initiate treatment for chronic diseases, dispense drugs as per standing orders by the
medical officer.
4. Such coordination could be facilitated through processes such as telehealth. However, MLHPs can
also provide medicines as per the provisions of Schedule K, Item 23.
5. Focus attention in screening for chronic conditions on screening, enabling suspected cases
confirmed and initiating treatment based on appropriate STGs or on basis of plans made by
medical officer/specialists. As a team, ensure adherence, along with counselling and support as
needed for primary and secondary prevention efforts. Such chronic conditions would include
both non-communicable diseases and the chronic communicable diseases of tuberculosis,
leprosy and HIV.
6. Coordinate and lead local response to diseases outbreaks, emergencies and disaster situations and
support the medical team or joint investigation teams for disease outbreaks.
7. Support the team of MPWs and ASHAs on their tasks, including on the job mentoring, support and
supervision and undertaking the monitoring, management, reporting and administrative functions
of the HWC such as inventory management, upkeep and maintenance, and management of untied
funds.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

23
8. Support and supervise the collection of population based data by frontline workers, collate and
analyse data for planning and report the data to the next level in an accurate and timely fashion. Use
HWC and population data to understand key causes of mortality, morbidity in the community and
work with the team to develop a local action plan with measurable targets, including a particular
focus on vulnerable communities.
9. Coordinate with community platforms such as the VHSNC/MAS/SHGs and work closely with PRI/
ULB, to address social determinants of health and promote behaviour change for improved health
outcomes.
10. Address issues of social and environmental determinants of health with extension workers of
other departments related to gender based violence, education, safe potable water, sanitation,
safe collection of refuse, proper disposal of waste water, indoor air pollution, and on specific
environmental hazards such as fluorosis, silicosis, arsenic contamination, etc.
11. Guide and be actively engaged in community health promotion including behaviour change
communication.
4.1.3 Training and Mentorship
The Mid Level Health providers would be trained in either Certificate Programme in Community Health,
managed and certified by IGNOU/ state universities or have a B.Sc. degree in Community Health.
The curriculum will enable the MLHP to attain a set of competencies related to public health and primary
health care. In order to accommodate the needs of rapid scale up, states would be encouraged to partner
with public /medical universities to also deliver the Certificate Programme. In addition, a modular course,
while retaining the core competences would also be explored, combining theoretical and experiential
components, and to enable the candidates to use a learning by doing approach.
To improve training quality states shall also institutionalize District Level Committee of Observers to
monitor the ongoing trainings. These committees can have representation from-Service providers of NGO
run hospitals/Nurse Training Colleges/Faculty of MPW Training Centres/Medical Colleges and Counsellors
from programme study centres and may submit feedback to State NHM/District Health Officers/CMHOs on
improvement areas if any.
In addition, states will need to create a strong mentorship programme including through programmes like
ECHO (Extension for Community Health Care Outcomes) for supporting the MLHPs through handholding,
trouble shooting, problem solving, to enable building of technical competencies and sustaining motivation.
The mentors could be drawn from schools of public health/medical colleges/district health teams/Technical
support agencies and development partners.
4.1.4 Career Progression
As the programme matures, and for MLHP to see an aspirational future trajectory, avenues for career
progression of Mid-Level Health Provider would be explored in public health functions up to block, and
district level, in synergy with the public health cadre. The figure below shows a proposed career progression
plan for the mid-level health providers.
While planning the career progression at block and district level, states have the flexibility to engage MLHPs
in different areas as appropriate. Further, as means to ensure retention, preference or reservation of seats for
MLHPs may be planned in other job opportunities at state/district level and in continuing Medical Education-
MSc, PG-DPHM courses etc.

4.2 Multi-Skilling of other Frontline Health Workers
Frontline workers, and Service Providers posted at all levels would also be multi-skilled to address the
mismatch in the services to be provided and present levels of training of primary care team members.
The key principle is that as many skills as possible and appropriate at that level should be available within
the team at the HWC, so that the services are assured to the population and the team is able to resolve
more at their level including through telehealth with fewer referrals. MPW (M & F) would need skills to
function as paramedics for undertaking laboratory, pharmacy and counselling functions. Similarly, at
the HWC-PHC level, staff would be appropriately skilled to function as ophthalmic technicians, dental
hygienists, physiotherapists, etc. Staff that opt to provide such services would be trained and equipped
with specific skills, and be provided with additional compensation. The use of technology would be
harnessed to undertake the training/multi-skilling given the sheer magnitude of the task. Platforms
such as ECHO, Massive Open Online Courses, SatCom, etc. would be used. States will need to enter into
partnerships with a range of academic and training organizations to help deliver such multi-skilling on
an ongoing basis. See Table 4.1 on Human Resource Requirements, Skill Requirements and Training for
details.

The use of standardized digital health record and establishing a seamless flow of information across all
levels of health care facilities is an aspirational goal. Such a system would take time to evolve. An IT system
has been envisioned at the Health and Wellness Centres and will need to be inter-operable with the overall
e- health architecture plans at the national and state level.
Use of Information Technology would be essential to enable efficient delivery of services at the HWCs. IT tool
would support the HWC team in recording the services delivered, in enabling follow up of service users, in
reporting to higher functionaries, and in population based analytics.
5.1. Key Functions of the IT system are as follows
5.1.1. Registration
zz Empanel all individuals and families in the catchment area and update this database regularly when
there is a new entrant into this area, or someone exits.
zz Facilitate identification and registration of beneficiaries/ families for Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya
Yojana as per laid down criteria.
zz Ensure that every family and individual have been allotted and are aware of their unique Health ID -
which would also be used to seek services under various programmes such as RCH/ RNTCP/ NVBDCP
etc and support beneficiaries to seek services under the PMJAY.
zz Link the unique health ID with the AADHAAR ID at the back end in line with the current statute and
Supreme Court directions.
zz Identify and merge duplicates by verifying IDs.
zz Create a longitudinal health record of each empanelled individual.
5.1.2. Service Delivery
zz Record all services that are delivered at the HWC under different programmes.
zz Enable follow up of services that individual patients are receiving by recording relevant parameters,
diagnostic results, medication given etc.
zz Send SMS/ reminders to individuals about the follow up visits.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

30
zz Facilitate clinical decision making for the service providers (based on standard treatment protocols).
zz Track and support upward and downward referrals to support continuity of care.
zz Ability to print key summary and prescription based on individual’s requirement.
zz Ability to provide standardized prescription, discharge summary and/or referral note which can be
scanned/photographed or printed and uploaded as per requirement.
zz Capture, store and transmit images to support teleconsultation, referral and follow up.
5.1.3. Management of Service Delivery
zz Capture service delivery coverage and measure health outcomes using population-based analytics.
zz Generate work plans for the teams with alert and reminder feature for services providers to support
scheduling of appointments, follow up home visits and outreach activities.
zz Use the service delivery data to validate use of services and enable Direct Bank Transfers to
beneficiaries wherever required.
zz Support Birth and death registrations and disease surveillance.
zz Capture record of other preventive and promotive services delivered, like vector control etc.
zz Send appropriate IEC/BCC messages.
5.1.4. Logistics
zz Support Inventory management and regular supply of medicines, vaccines and consumables by
linking with DVDMS – Drugs and Vaccines Delivery Management Systems.
zz Support biomedical equipment maintenance of all equipment by maintaining database for
equipment at HWC.
5.1.5. Capacity Building
zz Provide Job aids (in the form of flow charts or audio/ video aids) for continuous learning and support
of the primary health care team.
zz Support access to Massive open online courses (MOOC) and use of platform such as ECHO for regular
capacity building and problem solving for HWC teams both at SHC and PHC level.
5.1.6. Reporting and Monitoring
zz Generate population-based analytics reports for routine monitoring and to assess performance of
health care providers.
zz Support in generating performance matrix for all service providers, calculating incentives from the
service transaction data in the system.
5.1.7. Teleconsultation
zz Capture and transmit images, prescriptions and diagnostic reports for teleconsultation.
zz Support video call using platforms like zoom and skype to connect with hubs identified for
teleconsultation.

A core design principle to be followed while building CPHC IT system should be to support needs of diverse
stakeholders and strengthen service providers in undertaking their tasks with greater quality and efficiency,
and that the data required for monitoring and reviews by programme managers at different levels becomes
available.
The IT system would reduce the burden of data recording and reporting for front line workers and service
providers to less than 10% of their total time. Once the digital system has been made operational, and
all connectivity related challenges have been addressed, a gradual phase out of paper-based records and
registers can be planned, if the system can make paper prints out available to meet the requirement of
regular submission of Health Sub-Centre based reports for systems such as HMIS, IDSP, RCH portal and other
national health programme specific reports.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

Key Requirements
 Adherence to applicable standards laid down under Metadata and Data Standards for Health (MDDS) and EHR
standard developed by MoHFW.
 Ensure security and data privacy by providing secured role-based access system coupled with end-to-end
encryption. The system should adhere to the data privacy and security standards as per HER standards. In
addition, a detailed logging system with essential audit trails (for critical read/write/modify/delete operations)
and error reporting (android/mobile app notifications and emails) should be made operational.
 Configurability i.e., developed as a platform on which the various programs, state specific variations, family/
individual profile can be created - using metadata, configuration, pluggable user interface templates and
rules. This would support- a) Addition of new programmes, b) Change in program definition over time and c)
customization according to the local context and for various programs.
 High level of interoperability to integrate with state level MIS, RCH portal and other programme systems
functional at national and state level. The integration architecture should be compatible with the recommended
approaches in the MDDS for Health document and EHR standards.
 Ability to manage large data volumes i.e. approximately 6,000 active individual health service records as part
of about 1000 active family health records at Health Sub Centre level. System would be horizontally scalable by
addition of servers as to manage the high user load / data volume such that performance of the system is not
compromised.
 Ability to function on offline mode – (even when Internet is unavailable for long period) and allow for auto or
manual synchronization of data without any data loss when connection is available
 Application should be upgradeable via single click or auto-upgradeable by the end user without requirement of
any additional technical support.
In order to ensure smooth introduction and functioning of the IT system, there will be need to deploy a support
team that has the command over the functioning and technical details of the software system and will provide
training to the end users, systems managers at the district, block, and HWC level. This team would also support in
troubleshooting field level implementation issues from time to time.
Note – Population enumeration and database creation can start even without the software application base being
in place. The data base of the population in catchment area and the registration of the population for chronic
diseases should be started off in parallel with the upgrade of HWCs.
It is possible that data on basic demographic information may be available from existing population- based database
such as- Socio economic Caste Census (SECC), Aadhaar, Public Distribution System, National Population Register etc
and states can plan for obtaining such recently done survey data on migration if available. However, migration and
import of this data in the software system should be followed with verification by house to house visits by the field
level functionaries or verification at the time of empanelment in the Health and Wellness Centres. Authentication
of service users is also possible at the time of service delivery – by using biometric, OTP, or backend analytics of
photograph, if required.

6.1. Road Map and Planning for HWCs
Several states are now moving forward with the implementation of Health and Wellness Centres. Overall,
the designing, upgrading and establishment of HWCs should be such that states are able to achieve an
equitable distribution of health care with an efficient utilization of resources. Steps for states to follow while
planning HWCs are discussed below. The State, District and Sub district planning would vary based on local
context and states should adopt the guidelines to suit their needs.
6.1.1 Developing a Road Map
zz The first step for each state is to develop a short to medium term road map with number of Health
and Wellness Centres that will be created over a five-year period and also develop robust and
objective annual plans with specific targets for the state and district level to improve access to the
CPHC facilities, keeping in mind local context and capacity.
zz The plan should define target of the number of facilities (PHCs/Urban PHCs/ Sub Health Centres)
that can be upgraded to effectively deliver expanded range of services on a year on year basis.
6.1.2 Phasing and Identification of Districts
zz States should plan for a phase wise scale-up indicating districts that will be included in each phase.
zz Conforming to the overall principles of equity, selection of those districts should be prioritized
in the initial phase, which align with the ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ Programme of
Government of India. The programme for Universal Screening Prevention and Management of
Common Non- Communicable Diseases has been rolled out in all the states and has been prioritized
in districts where the National Programme for Control of Cancer, Diabetes and Cardiovascular
Diseases has been well implemented. An overlap of Health and Wellness Centres with districts
selected for Universal Screening of NCDs should be planned to leverage pre-existing investment in
health systems to deliver care for NCDs.
6.1.3 Selection of Blocks
zz Once the plan and phasing across the districts is clear, states should select the blocks, which would
be taken up for creating HWCs. Within a district, the programme may be commenced in good
performing blocks with human resources and better referral support. While doing so, simultaneous
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

34
attention will be required to identify and address HR/infrastructure gaps in other blocks to gradually
include them in HWCs development plan for future phases.
zz The plan should be to take up all SHCs and PHCs within any chosen block for upgradation into
HWCs. In certain contexts, block saturation will be a challenge owing to constraints in availability of
human resources, infrastructure, and geographic inaccessibility. In such cases, in the first year, state
may plan to operationalize HWCs in 60-70% Sub Health Centres in the selected block and undertake
necessary measures to strengthen HR and infrastructure in remaining Sub Health Centres so as to
make them functional by next year. Within a block, such PHCs that are relatively well performing
with MBBS MO should be prioritized for transforming as HWC. SHCs which are linked to these PHCs
can be upgraded to HWCs to maintain continuum of care.
zz The block level plan should identify facilities, which can serve as referral centre or for the cluster of HWCs.
The referral center may vary for different services depending on the nearest site where the necessary
skills are available. Thus, the MO in the PHC would be adequate for initiating treatment for chronic
communicable diseases but for attending to a patient with a serious mental illness/NCD, consultation
with concerned specialists at the nearest facility would be needed. However, the bulk of such referral
needs are likely to be attended at the Sub-Divisional Hospital, a FRU- CHC or a Block PHC.
zz Sub Health Centres for upgrading as Health and Wellness Centres should be prioritized:
a. Where a community of about 3000- 5,000 populations is not within the reach of a PHC/ Block-
PHC /CHC or a Sub-Divisional Hospital within 30 minutes.
b. Where population coverage of Sub Health Centres could be lower but access available to serving
population is constrained due to geographic access or otherwise and travel time to reach the
Sub-Centre from the most remote place in the coverage area is more than half an hour.
c. Where progress of health indicators is significantly lower than the block/district average due to
social and cultural barriers of access such as the case of tribal hamlets, villages with high density
of marginalized and vulnerable population groups etc.
zz The Sub Health Centres situated within a distance of 1-2 km from the referral centres could be
upgraded as Health and Wellness Centre at a late stage if required.
zz However, population covered by these centres should be linked with the designated referral centre
and population empanelment, health risk profiling and other outreach activities for CPHC services
will continue to be provided by the team of Multi-Purpose Workers and ASHAs.
6.2 Infrastructure for Health and Wellness Centres
zz Ensuring adequate infrastructure for the delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health Care and Health
and Wellness Centres would need to cater to a population size as per IPHS norms for Sub Health
Centers- one per 5000 population in all areas and one per 3000 in tribal, hilly and desert areas. Where
currently sub-centers are catering to much larger population, their numbers need to be increased.
zz Planning for infrastructure upgrade succeeds the finalization of number and type of facilities
designated as Health and Wellness Centres. Most states have completed the development of
infrastructure for PHCs/Additional PHCs, UPHC but there will be a need to undertake minor civil
repair and infrastructure upgrade for existing buildings for meeting necessary gaps in enabling
these centres to deliver patient friendly services.
zz Patient reception and registration centers, citizen charters, electronic display boards for services,
provision of sitting arrangement of patients, other amenities in the waiting area, TV screens for health
communication, facilities for people with disabilities, provision of privacy for patient examination
area/ examination table, good quality lab, pharmacy, a wellness room for conducting physiotherapy/
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

35
Yoga sessions, rehabilitative services, separate toilets for males and females etc. may be included in
infrastructure upgrade.
zz Major civil infrastructure upgrade would largely be required for developing the Sub Health Centres
as Health and Wellness Centre. Essential requirements for strengthening a SHC to serve as a Health
and Wellness Centres are:
zA well-ventilated clinic room with examination space and office space for Mid-Level Health
Provider/Community Health Officer.
zStorage space for storing medicines, equipment, documents, health cards and registers.
zDesignated space for lab/diagnostic.
zSeparate male and female toilets.
zDeep burial pit for Bio Medical Waste Management.
zProper system for drainage.
zAssured water supply that can be drawn and stored locally.
zElectricity supply linked to main lines or adequate solar source, inverter or back-up generator as
appropriate.
zPatient waiting area covered to accommodate at least 20-25 chairs.
zRepairs of roofs and walls, plastering, painting and tiling of floors to be undertaken as per
requirement.
zSpace/room for Yoga if adequate space for expansion is available.
zAdequate residential facilities for the service providers.
zRain water harvesting facilities may be planned if required.
zz Once the numbers of SHC to be upgraded as Health and Wellness Centres are final the identified
blocks will need to systematically map Sub Health Centres: with and without buildings.
zz For a PHC- HWC, infrastructure would be as per current Indian Public Health Standards.
zz The concerned Block Medical Officer and a representative from the Engineering wing at the district
level will do a joint site inspection and complete gap analysis for repair/renovation in existing
buildings. The analysis should be based on the essential requirements stated above and will support
in estimating necessary financial resources.
zz A costed prototype for planning civil modification of existing Sub Health Centres buildings and new
construction will be made available by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.
zz States and district should consider the earmarked fund support of 7 lakh/SHC-HWC or 4 lakh PHC-
HWC as a pooled grant rather than fixed grant per facility for infrastructure modification.
zz When new construction is being planned, location of HWCs should be decided through a consultative
process involving community, gram panchayat members, community forest rights committees,
frontline health functionaries, Block Medical Officers and others. Construction of new building should
be preferably undertaken in a central location with high population density and not in peripheral
sites of the villages. Acquiring of land for this purpose would be a priority for the district.
zz To save time and optimize resources, identification of government buildings available with other
departments could be prioritized for operationalizing HWCs after necessary renovation.
zz Old dilapidated buildings should be considered for renovation only after careful review of resources
required. Wherever existing sub-centres are in dilapidated condition, it will be more cost effective to
plan for a new HWC.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

zz Though financial provision for repair and new construction are made available under the National
Health Mission, resource mobilization for new construction could also be explored from different
government programmes such as- Members of Parliament/Members of Legislative Assembly Local
Area Development Scheme, Labour component support available under Mahatma Gandhi National
Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), District Mineral funds wherever applicable, Untied
funds available with Local Self Governments in urban and rural areas, District Innovation Funds and
other state government development programmes. Funding under NHM say, 50% support, should
be provided to leverage support from above mentioned potential sources. Support from Corporate
Social Responsibility and philanthropic organizations, NABARD, special funds like tribal affairs,
minorities may also be explored.
zz Convergent action will be needed at district level to identify land for new construction of HWCs. The
MLHP/MPW (M/F) should be involved in site selection. This should be close to community and have
access to essential amenities.
zz Private buildings could be taken on rent, may be as an interim measure, however; the buildings
identified should adhere to the specified infrastructure norms for strengthening a sub health centre
to serve as a Health and Wellness Centres as much possible.

MediCiNeS, diAGNOSTiCS
ANd OTHeR SUPPLieS
The credibility of a Health and Wellness Centre rests on the availability of essential medicines and diagnostics
for a wide range of health care needs of the population served by the HWC. In line with the paradigm shift
envisaged, the HWC will provide a broader range of services and this necessitates expanding the list of
essential medicines and diagnostic services currently available.
7.1. Medicines at HWC
Medicines listed as per essential list of medicines for a PHC/Sub health Centre need to be ensured at
respective HWCs. Additional medicines will be required at the HWC as the range of services expands.
Suggestive essential medicine list for a SHC-HWC is at Annexure 1. The indicative list of medicines is as per
National List of Essential Medicines 2015, this will be updated periodically based on new protocols and
states will have the flexibility to adapt the list as appropriate.
Certain medicines for treatment of identified patients with chronic diseases (Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus,
Epilepsy, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Mental Disorders, and patients requiring palliative care)
can be indented by the Mid-Level Health Provider, from the PHC/referral center essential medicine list. For a
patient suspected of a chronic disease, confirmation and initiation of treatment will be by the Medical Officer
at the PHC or a higher referral centre. However, for continuation of treatment, medicines will be dispensed at
SHC-HWCs by MLHP to avoid patient hardship and ensure that the clinical condition is monitored regularly.
Based on the records in the health folder (electronic/manual), the MLHP will generate each month, a list of
patients on treatment for chronic illnesses in the population served by HWC. The IT system envisaged at the
HWC level would help the MLHP in stock management and estimating the requirement of medicines based
on actual caseloads. According to the patient list, the MLHP can indent medicines from PHC- EML/ referral
centre- EML for a three - month period per patient. The medicines are provided every month to the patient.
Patients would be encouraged to come to the HWC so that their health status can be monitored. Home
based distribution is recommended only for patients who are not able to travel. A list of these medicines is
attached in Annexure 2.
7.2. Diagnostics to be available at HWC
The HWC should have the capacity to deliver a minimum range of basic diagnostics and screening capabilities
for conditions that are mandated to be screened/treated at this level. Diagnostic services as per the Guidelines
for National Free Diagnostic Initiative need to be available at HWC (SHC-7 and PHC-19 investigations).
In addition, a Peak Flow Meter and Snellen’s and Near Vision Chart are recommended for inclusion at SHC-HWCs.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

38
7.2.1. Point of Care Diagnostics
There is a plethora of diagnostics, several of them are “point of care” that are currently available. However, the
choice of those that need to be included should be taken after validation and Health Technology Assessment.
On completion of HTA, states may consider use of the innovative diagnostics solutions from those empanelled
through Government E-Market Place. Pilots on use of innovative diagnostics solutions may be planned and
linked to innovation portal of NHM for further validation and Health Technology Assessment.
7.2.2. Hub and Spoke Model
With regards to the diagnostic services at the HWC, the primary objective is to minimize the movement of
the patient and improve the timeliness of reporting. This can be achieved by following the hub and spoke
model by creating the hub (Central Diagnostic Unit) at CHC or block level PHC for 20-30 HWCs, depending
on the distance and population served. State will need to define context specific protocols for peripheral
collection of samples from HWCs.
At the level of PHC- HWC, availability of diagnostics and medicine would be ensured as per the existing IPHS
and Essential Medicine List PHC. A suggestive list of diagnostics to be available at HWC and CDU is attached
in Annexure 3.
7.3. Rational Use of Diagnostics and Medicines
Medicines and diagnostics at the HWC should be made available as per the specified clinical pathways and
standard treatment guidelines for all services. Clear treatment protocols ensure the correct and efficacious
use of medicines and diagnostics. Monthly review meetings at sector PHC/ CHC will be a platform for
dissemination of updated standard treatment protocols to the primary health care team. Service providers-
MLHPs, MPWs and PHC staff will need to be trained to undertake counselling for rational use of medicines and
appropriate consumptions based on treatment plan. States/Districts should plan for periodic prescription
audits, robust quality checks on quality of medicines, use of IT system for ensuring rational use of medicines
and diagnostics through periodic training of members from primary care team.
7.4. Equipment and Supplies at HWC
Equipment as well as consumables will be added at the HWC level in accordance with the expanded range
of services. Similar to medicines, certain consumables will be indented by MLHP as per requirement from
PHC/ referral centre. E.g. for home based palliative care of a patient in area catered by SHC-HWC, a kit will
be maintained by MLHP at HWC and required consumables will be indented. Indicative list of items for
Equipment and Supplies is attached in Annexure 4. The list of equipment is exhaustive and can be made
available in incremental manner as range of services expand and budget provision increases.
7.5. Streamlining Supply Chain Logistics
In order to provide the assured set of services detailed in the previous section, availability of essential
medicines and developing basic diagnostic facilities at the HWC is a priority. Issue of poor outcomes related
to supply side deficiencies need to be addressed for this. Assured medicine availability closer to the homes of
patients would support in treatment compliance for long term illnesses where patients generally discontinue
the treatment due to the challenges of medicine refills. It would also have an impact on the levels of out of
pocket expenditures and establish the credibility of public health care delivery system.
The first step would be to make all medicines as per the SHC- EML and consumables, equipment for
diagnostics listed as per the SHC- Indian Public Health Standards available at the HWC. Subsequently,
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

39
additional medicines and equipment as well as consumables for diagnostics will be added at the HWC level
in accordance with the expanded range of services.
The Essential Medicine List will guide the procurement and supply of medicines. The DVDMS system needs
to be extended to the PHC level in those states where it is operational and be enabled on a priority basis
where it is yet to be implemented. In future, efforts will be made to incorporate demographics of patients in
e-Aushadhi software- and enable linkage with patient wise consumption data to estimate real time need.
In order to ensure free medicines and diagnostics, the state will have to ensure a state level robust system for
procurement, involving real time utilization based indenting, well timed tendering, finalization of technical
and financial bids, measures of rate contracting etc. A streamlined distribution, logistics and quality assurance
is required that allows supply chain management to be responsive to changing and diverse patterns of
consumption of consumables across facilities.
7.6. Planning Equipment and Supplies
SPMU/DPMUs could plan to provide equipment and supplies under the following categories to enable
delivery of quality Comprehensive Primary Health Care services:
zz Medicines and Vaccines
zz Clinical Tools, material and equipment
zz Linens and Consumables
zz Furniture and Fixtures
zz Laboratory and Diagnostic Materials
Most of these equipment and materials indicated in annexure would be available in the existing Health
Sub health Centres. An efficient utilization of resources would demand a sub-centre wise gap analysis of
available materials to avoid duplication and plan procurement only for those items, which are either not
available, not functional or required in additional quantity.
* In case of creating HWCs at the PHCs, additional provision can be made for equipment at Wellness Room, which would involve-basic physiotherapy
equipment, tools for exercise, mats etc. for arranging yoga sessions. In addition, a spirometer needs to be available at PHCs linked to HWCs, for confirmation
of COPD.

QUALiTY Of CARe
To ensure effective delivery of primary health care services, it is essential that protocols for quality assurance
are institutionalized at HWC. Mere availability of services is not enough and the services need to be accessible,
safe, patient-centred, acceptable, equitable and provided with dignity and confidentiality. In order to assure
that quality standards are followed. the following critical measures should be taken:
a. Provision of Patient Centred and respectful care.
b. Enable Patient Amenities at HWC.
c. Adhere to standard treatment guidelines and clinical protocols for care provision.
d. Achieve Indian Public Health Standards with regards to HR, infrastructure, equipment, service
delivery and supplies.
e. Implement the National Quality Assurance Standards for public health facilities, by focusing on eight
critical areas - a) Service provision, b) Patient rights, c) Inputs d) Support services, e) Clinical services,
f) Infection control, g) Quality management and h) Health outcomes.
8.1. Patient Centred Care
The care in the community, at outreach and at the HWC should be responsive to needs, respectful and
meet the aspirations of individual service users. It should be delivered in ways that take into cognizance the
dignity of the individual, the needs and circumstances of the family, and the culture of the community. The
HWC has been conceived so that the smaller populations, the team based approach and the availability of
a large number of services enable a more improved patient provider relationship, and the establishment of
trust in the public health system.
8.2. Standard Treatment Guidelines
Compliance to Standard Treatment Guidelines would enhance safety and improve patient outcomes.
It would also enable parameters of uniform standards of care delivery among service providers across different
levels of care and would facilitate continuity of care for patients. The STGs would enable identification of
medicines that can be dispensed and administered at the primary care / HWC level. In addition, STGs would
define for each level of care, the management of the specified condition with referral linkages, requirement
of medicines, diagnostics, consumables and skill sets required. As an immediate step, states should ensure
that all existing Standard Treatment Guidelines under various national health programmes are available at
HWC level and are adhered to through close supervision and monitoring.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

42
8.3. National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS)
National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) will be developed for HWC. The primary health care team
would be trained to assess and improve key processes to deliver safe, timely, and accessible care. Similar
to the process of accreditation followed in case of other facilities, the achievement of accreditation in HWC
would also enable recognition and awards.
Other quality measures include implementation of Infection Control Measures, Biomedical Waste
Management, and patient satisfaction and survey measures.
Key points to consider while ensuring quality:
zz Experience from implementing NQAS in preparation for certification indicates that while availability
of standards is crucial, it does not actually translate in to outcomes.
zz Provider competency, behaviour, attitude and efforts are critical for delivering quality services,
particularly at the HWC level, since this will serve as the first point of entry in to the system. Provider
performance will in turn depend upon training, availability of STGs, protocols, supervision, and
feedback.
zz The MoHFW is in the process of developing standards for process and outcomes for ambulatory
care, particularly focussed on effectiveness and patient safety.

9.1. Health Promotion and Social Behavioural Change Communication
Health promotion and information provision at the community level is an integral part of the expanded
range of services under Comprehensive Primary Health Care. Health is affected by various social and
environmental determinants and actions to address these issues often do not fall in the purview of health
systems alone and therefore requires intersectoral convergence and people’s participation.
The Health Promotion strategy recommended by the National Health Policy 2017 emphasizes
institutionalizing intersectoral coordination at national and sub-national levels to optimize health
outcomes, through constitution of bodies that have representation from relevant non-health ministries.
This should be in line with the emergent international “Health in All” approach as complement to Health for All.
As envisioned in the policy, States should plan for a coordinated action on seven priority areas for improving
the environment for health as part of CPHC:
zz The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
zz Balanced, healthy diets and regular exercises.
zz Addressing tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse.
zz Yatri Suraksha – preventing deaths due to rail and road traffic accidents.
zz Nirbhaya Nari –action against gender violence.
zz Reduced stress and improved safety in the work place.
zz Reducing indoor and outdoor air pollution.
States will need to develop strategies and institutional mechanisms in each of the seven areas, to create
“Swasth Nagrik Abhiyan” –a social movement for health in the form of Jan Andolan. Indicators and targets
could also be defined to track progress for achievement in each of these areas.
9.2. Target Groups for Health Promotion
Given below are few examples of health promotion strategies that can be planned for different target groups.
These are only illustrative and need to be expanded to develop a context specific health promotion strategy
based on local needs.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

44
9.2.1. General Population
This group is targeted for primary prevention.
Example:
zz Population education on life style modifications such as healthy diet, regular exercise to prevent
cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
zz Organizing sanitation drives for clean surroundings to prevent the spread of communicable diseases-
malaria, gastroenteritis etc.
zz Nutrition counselling in adolescents and women in reproductive age group to address issues of
low birth weight in new-borns, promotion of early initiation of breastfeeding to prevent childhood
illnesses.
zz Displaying information by shopkeepers and retailers on High Fat Salt and Sugar (HFSS) Display Board
with information on the daily FSS requirement that is not to be exceeded etc.
zz Including section on healthy diets and arranging special session to promote health nutrition habits
in school going children etc.
9.2.2. Population at Risk
This is for population groups, which have high risk of developing a disease/disorder and has higher exposure
to risk factors.
Example:
zz Targeted Behavioural Change strategies for population at risk of HIV/AIDS such as- female sex
workers, MSM, truck drivers, migrant labours etc. and planning interventions to promote healthy
behaviours that include messages to- decrease the number of sexual partners, safe sexual intercourse,
counselling and testing for HIV, adherence to biomedical strategies -decrease sharing of needles
and syringes, and decrease substance use etc.
zz Ensure regular screening of adults for NCDs.
9.2.3. Individuals with Symptoms
This is for individuals and population groups who show obvious signs of a disease condition.
Example:
zz Home visits by frontline functionaries for early identification of symptoms, prompt referral and
follow up of cases like high-risk pregnancies, high-risk new born, malnourished children, and passive
surveillance for malaria etc.
9.2.4. Population with Known Disorders
Example:
zz Individual and family counselling- for treatment compliance and lifestyle modifications through
home visits by ASHAs as part of interventions for NCDs, disease- based patient support groups –for
improved compliance, IEC activities using patient education leaflets, banners, posters, etc. for NCDs
and other morbidities.
Note: Health promotion is not restricted to health education and behaviour change communication; but it has a broader
perspective and includes all responsive measures discussed above; which have a direct or indirect bearing on health such
as inequities, changes in the patterns of consumption, environment, cultural beliefs etc.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

9.3. Ensuring Wellness and Health Promotion through YOGA and Mainstreaming
of AYUSH
Under Ayushman Bharat India’s rich tradition of indigenous health, system and Yoga will be mainstreamed
into the health care delivery system, by actively engaging practitioners of these systems. Health and Wellness
Centres provide a sound platform for enabling this integration. This will require close coordination with
Ministry of AYUSH/Department of AYUSH at the state and district level. To operationalize integration with
Yoga and AYUSH, states and districts will need to:
zz Identify a pool of Local Yoga Instructors at the HWC level. These could be an ASHA, ASHA Facilitator,
Physical Instructor from village school, representatives from VHSNC, or other NGO groups active in
community.
zz Plan for systematic graded training and certification of these local Yoga Teachers. Department of
AYUSH will lead this activity by identifying a pool of YOGA experts/YOGA schools who can undertake
this training at the state/district/Sub-district level.
zz Fix and widely disseminate weekly/monthly schedule of classes for Community Yoga Training at
the HWCs. If space permits these classes could ideally be held in premises of HWC or in the nearby
school, Panchayat Bhawan or even AWC.
zz Earmark and disburse incentive/honorarium for these YOGA teachers that could be provided on a
per session basis.
zz Fix one day a week for conducting Ayurveda Clinics. These will particularly aim for useful diet
counselling, management of chronic aches and pains, elderly care etc.
9.4. Agents and Platforms for Health Promotion
9.4.1 Mid-Level Health Provider
MLHP will provide individual and family based health promotion in HWCs and community. The MLHP will
coordinate the health promotion activities via frontline workers, VHSNCs/MAS/SHGs/NGOs and patient
support groups. The MLHP will ensure that it reaches all segments of population.
9.4.2 ASHA
zz ASHAs have been an important community level resource to improve access to health care services
in the areas of RCH and communicable diseases. The shift from ‘selective primary healthcare’ to
‘Comprehensive Primary Health Care’ would require ASHAs to play a key role as member of primary
health care team at HWC. Continuing to perform their three roles– that of a facilitator, health
activist and service provider at the community level she will be vital in improving access to care and
undertake health promotion activities. However, focus of her work will now encompass wider range
of services of RCH and communicable diseases to new services such as management of common
NCDs, ophthalmology, oral health, elderly and palliative care. ASHAs would be able to provide the
new services being rolled out under CPHC.
zz As some of these conditions are chronic involving long-term treatment and life style modifications
for management, ASHAs would need additional capacity building to undertake the tasks of health
promotion, timely referral and active follow up for compliance.
zz Health Promotion by ASHAs would use the same principles of listing the target population,
community mobilization, supporting the HWC team in organizing camps (like VHNDs/ UHNDs) on
a periodic basis, reaching the marginalized, support treatment compliance and follow up similar to
follow up of her existing beneficiaries (pregnant women, new born and TB/ Leprosy patients etc).
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

46
zz The long-term management of chronic illnesses requires active engagement of community members
also. ASHAs would need to play the lead role in formation and functioning of disease specific patient
support groups. They would also support the Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees/
Mahila Arogya Samitis in community level planning and action and building accountability measures
at the community level.
9.4.3. Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees, Mahila Arogya Samitis, Self-Help
Groups, Women Collectives
zz VHSNC/ MAS are key community level forums to facilitate intersectoral convergence, local planning
and action to address issues related to access and quality of care. They should lead the community
action plan for surveillance and action on vector- borne disease control programmes, addressing risk
modification for common NCDs, and undertaking social health campaigns for health promotion.
zz VHSNC/ MAS should also engage with existing women groups and ensure greater participation
of women to enable gender equity and promoting women’s health issues. VHNSC should actively
involve with Panchayat Raj Institutions representatives to build capacities for community level
planning, action and monitoring to address social determinants of health. In urban areas, MAS
would need to work closely with the representatives of Urban Local Bodies and existing community-
based groups. Such joint efforts would be useful to undertake activities such as addressing sources
reduction for vector borne diseases, promoting regular exercise and sports to promote healthy life
styles, supporting the primary care team in outreach activities, reaching remote hamlets, and acting
against alcohol, tobacco and other forms of substance abuse.
zz The VHSNC/MAS, ASHA and her support mechanisms will play a critical role in delivery of
Comprehensive Primary Health Care by demand generation for Health and Wellness Centres.
They will need to undertake large-scale community level IEC activities planned in the form of
campaigns, distribution of print materials and through folk programmes. These campaigns would
inform the community about services offered at HWCs.
zDetails of the service providers-Multi-purpose workers, ASHA, Mid-Level Health Providers and
PHC Medical Officers.
zBenefits of HWC (closely accessible, Medicines available for all common ailments, collection of
medicine refills, reduction in the chances of incurring out of pocket expenditure by families etc.)
zOpening hours and location, importance of enrolment in HWC and availing the first screening
services.
zz These agents of Health Promotion will also play a critical role in building awareness for the other
pillar of Ayushman Bharat-The PMJAY and inform the community about the various government
schemes for financial risk protection and in helping the people understand where to avail, how to
avail these schemes, who are the providers, what are specific entitlements under these schemes and
what are the mechanisms of linkages for availing these health insurance benefits.
States will need to develop a monthly calendar of activities/campaigns/meetings for engagement of VHSNCs/
MAS. This will support in organizing systematic action on health promotion activities to be undertaken by
these groups.
9.4.4. Patient Support Groups
zz Formation of Patient support groups is facilitated by the MPWs/ASHA or other frontline workers
around particular disease conditions to improve treatment compliance and engaging not only those
with the disease condition but also family member.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

47
zz They are a useful mechanism to improve treatment compliance and engaging not only those with
the disease condition but also family members. PSGs provide a platform wherein patients with
similar illness and their family members or caregivers can have an open discussion about the disease,
challenges associated with the illness and its treatment.
zz Such groups would help patients and their family members by providing mutual support, providing
information about diseases, raising awareness about complications, countering discrimination
and stigma attached to a particular disease and enabling support for treatment continuation and
changes in lifestyle behaviour.
zz The ASHA should be actively engaged in facilitating these group discussions and must ensure that
individuals from marginalised groups with the same disease condition are supported to become
part of these groups.
9.4.5. AYUSHMAN Ambassadors
zz In addition to Health and Wellness Centres and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, the Ayushman
Bharat aims to create about 2.2 million Health and Wellness Ambassadors in 1.1 million public
schools for prevention and promotion of diseases among school children.
zz The Ayushman Ambassadors or the Health and Wellness Ambassadors will be schoolteachers (one
male and one female) who will be responsible for age appropriate learning for promotion of healthy
behaviour and prevention of various diseases at the school level. This programme will ensure age
appropriate skill-oriented, theme-based sessions for schoolchildren for which “Health and Wellness
Ambassadors” will be trained in graded curriculum to implement the activities at primary, middle
and high school level.
zz The training will help to transact health promotion and disease prevention information in the form
of interesting activities for one hour every week. 20-hour sessions will be delivered through weekly
structured interactive classroom-based activities.
zz Every Tuesday will be dedicated as Health and Wellness Day in the schools.
zz These health promotion messages will also have bearing on improving health practices in the
country and students will act as Health and Wellness Messengers in the society. This will help them,
their parents and the families these students raise in future. Regular reinforcement of messages/
themes through IEC/BCC activities such as interactive activities/posters/class room/Assembly
discussion and field level will need to be undertaken. Existing teacher capacity building mechanism
and infrastructure of District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) will be appropriately utilized
for capacity building of Health and Wellness Ambassadors.
9.5. Inter-Sectoral Convergence for Health Promotion
zz Convergence is central for the success of health promotion strategies and require close
coordination of health with other allied departments. Convergence has so far been undertaken
with- education department for school- based health promotion camps, with ICDS for organizing
camps and community level educational meetings on healthy diet, immunization, addressing
malnutrition in children at AWCs during Village Health and Nutrition Days, with WCD for
implementing Weekly Iron and Folic Implementation programme/Rashtriya Bal Swasthya
Karyakram in AWCs for children in 2-6 years age group. Convergence initiatives to address spread
of outbreaks of communicable diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, malaria for sanitation
drives, vector control, controlling water coagulation, through cleaning of drains etc. are observed
with rural development or municipal bodies in rural and urban areas respectively.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

48
zz Intersectoral convergence would now be required for promoting healthy behaviours related to
NCDs. For example-different departments will need to come together to address the rising burden
of dietary risk factors that are among the leading causes of health risk in Indian population and lead
to increasing burden of death and disability from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and also from
cancer. Eat Right Toolkit developed by FSSAI should also be used to promote healthy diets.
zz Health department will need to ensure that programmes such as - Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram,
Rashtriya Kishore Swasthaya Karyakram, NPCDCS and Shaala Siddhi etc. to be focused now on both
under and over nutrition.
zz Other than Ayushman Ambassadors convergence from education may help in promoting
better cooking practices for Mid- Day Meal programmes, training of MDM cooks, for enabling
mandatory School Nutrition Clubs and competitions around health awareness for High fat,
sugar and salty foods.
zz Similarly, coordination from Women and Child Development will help in building awareness on ill
effects of overweight-obesity through its flagship programmes like Integrated Child Development
Services (ICDS), Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS), Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana
(IGMSY) and through SABLA, which mainly focuses on adolescent girls.
zz Environmental Protection activities including provision of safe water, vector control, improvement of
housing, control measures to check poor air quality etc. will also require intersectoral convergence.
zz The states should plan health education and communication strategy in close coordination with
Ministry of Rural development. Meetings with Zilla Panchayat, Block Panchayat and and Gram
Panchayat need to be planned, at the commencement of HWCs. Later phased meetings at each
of these levels would support in planning avenues and strategies for health promotion related to
various dimensions of primary care.
zz Existing guidelines under all programmes of MOHFW need to be suitably amended in light of the
enhanced capacities and services being rendered by the HWCs.

PROGRAMMe MANAGeMeNT
The goal of delivering Comprehensive Primary Health Care effectively in an equitable manner requires
substantial change management. Robust and effective management strategies would need to be adopted
to facilitate among other things, re-organization of health care services, intersectoral convergence and
institutionalize mechanism for performance-linked payment for service providers.
Since the Comprehensive Primary Health Care approach relies primarily on integration of existing service
delivery structures of various programme components under the NHM and intersectoral convergence, it
is important that the nodal officers of different programmes such as RCH, NPCDCS, NVBDCP, Community
Processes and Quality Assurance work in a coordinated manner, led by Assistant Mission Director or Joint /
Deputy Director at the state level. Additional consultants (two for small states and three for big states) can
be hired to support the process of planning, implementation and monitoring.
Nodal officers for this initiative at district level would need to be carefully selected from the rank of Deputy CMHO
or DPM or DCM, based on their past performance and commitment demonstrated to improve the public health
systems. It is desirable that an additional post is created at the district level programme management unit to
manage the CPHC roll out. Similarly, the nodal officer should be selected at the block level from BMO or BPM or
BCM based on performance and commitment. Roles for CPHC Management staff are listed in Annexure 5.
In order to improve the management mechanisms, following processes would be institutionalized:
a. Performance based payments: Mechanisms of performance linked payments and team-based
incentives would be introduced to improve the performance of the service providers at HWCs and
the overall performance of health systems.
b. Use of iT tool for periodic review, supervision and monitoring: Reports generated and data
captured by the IT system should be used during district and block level monthly meetings to
encourage “conversations on data”. This would facilitate improving quality of care, improving
coverage of population and tracking health outcomes using the information available from the data
so generated.
c. Capacity Building: Regular capacity building of programme managers at all levels and service
providers through periodic workshops at state and district level should be conducted for refreshing
skills and dissemination of new guidelines and protocols.
d. Supportive Supervision: Monthly visits would be undertaken by the PHC MOIC to the SHC to
provide on the job mentoring and hand holding support. In addition, quarterly review meetings of
block nodal officers at district level and biannual meetings of district nodal officers at the state level
should be planned to act as a forum for performance review and problem solving.
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

50
e. Social recognition: In addition to team-based incentives, annual awards based on pre-defined
criteria can be introduced for Primary Health Care teams as well as individual performers at state
and district level. This would create a sense of social recognition and may enhance the motivation
levels of the Primary Health Care team to improve the performance.
The change management for this strategy would also require extensive public health and technical expertise.
The National Health Systems Resource Centre would provide technical support to all States/UTs for strengthening
primary health care and operationalizing HWCs. It is recommended that states should identify reputed Public
Health Organizations/Academic/Research Organizations available within the government or Non-Government
Organization to serve as the State Level Technical Partners in rolling out the Comprehensive Primary Health
Care services through Health and Wellness Centres. The process of selection of Technical Partners would be state
specific and could involve a process of composite bidding with higher weightage for technical competence than
cost-based parameters alone. States could also use an already existing Technical Agency such as the State Health
Resource Centers, working under a formal agreement with the State NHM/Departments of Health, which has
demonstrated expertise and competence in supporting other government initiatives.

10.1. Monitoring
The designated programme management team at state and district level would be responsible for overall
monitoring and supervision of the HWCs. At field level, the block nodal officer oversees the HWC roll out and
monitors the progress made on a monthly basis. The IT platform would support generation of reports for
population-based indicators and disease surveillance for effective programme monitoring at block, district
and state level. States should use the existing indicators and data sources for monitoring till the IT system is
able to provide programme specific reports.
In addition to the regular supervision and monitoring by the programme managers, states can also make the
provision for Independent Monitoring to assess the effectiveness of the programme, evaluate the service
delivery outputs, track improvements in health outcomes or for assessing the performance of HWCs team
for the disbursal of team-based incentives.

States can identify technical agencies, public health organizations, academic institutions and research
organizations to serve as Independent Monitors. Support of national and state level technical partners can
be taken for the selection of such agencies for Independent Monitoring.
The following indicators may be used for monitoring the HWC services during the first phase. Based on the
programme roll out, additional indicators may be added for the remaining services like – ophthalmology,
ENT, mental health, elderly care, oral health, etc.

10.2. Grievance Redressal Mechanism
The existing mechanisms for grievance Redressal should be also extended to cover all services at Health
and Wellness Centre. Dial 104 Helpline should be universalised and capture grievances or gaps relating to
HWCs.
10.3. Community Based Monitoring and Social Accountability
The institutional frameworks set up for Community Based Monitoring and ensuring social accountability
under the National Health Mission would continue to be strengthened to support the process of CPHC
implementation. The facility surveys, preparation of score sheets and wide dissemination of the results
through public hearings and dialogues will also be applicable for Health and Wellness Centres. Institutional
structures operational for community-based monitoring such as Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition
Committees and Community Action for Health will monitor delivery of preventive, promotive and curative
service as part of CPHC and will continue to provide relevant inputs for decentralized health planning.
This will support in increasing the accountability of the primary healthcare system to the Community and
service users.
As has been made mandatory for other public health facilities under NHM, it would be compulsory for all
the Health and Wellness Centres to prominently display information regarding financial support received,
medicines and vaccines in stock, services provided to the patients as citizen’s charter etc.
The VHSNCs/MAS facilitated by ASHAs/MPWs-F at the community level, the Rogi Kalyan Samitis at the
facility level and structures for Community Action for Health would monitor the performance of the Health
and Wellness Centres and other facilities in terms of- delivering the extended ranges of services, minimizing
out of pocket expenditures by service users, free provision of essential medicines and diagnostics, patient
centric care provision etc and suggest corrective measures for improving the performance.
All Public Reports on Health at the National, State and the district levels would report progress made on
implementation of Comprehensive Primary Health Care. States should nominate and involve Civil Society
Organizations, NGOs and other resource institutions and create a monitoring arrangement to track the
progress, effectiveness and quality of health services.

The Health and Wellness Centres along with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana under the Ayushman
Bharat are flagship initiatives of the Government of India. The budgetary allocation for the Health and
Wellness Centres would be made under the National Health Mission as part of the State PIP fund allocations
based on the principles followed for other programmes under the Mission.
11.1. Financial Provisions
Fund requirement for upgrading and operationalizing Health and Wellness Centres would vary depending
on the type of facility i.e. SHCs, PHCs and Urban PHCs. In addition to the existing funds available under
NHM and state budget for these facilities, additional funds would be required for the following additional
components of HWCs:
a. Human Resource
b. IEC
c. IT support
d. Diagnostics
e. Infrastructure Strengthening
f. Independent Monitoring
Indicative costing of these additional components based on type of health facility is illustrated in Tables 1-3.

The budget has been estimated assuming the normative population coverage of 5000 per SHC, 30,000 per
PHC and 50,000 per UPHC. These cost requirements may vary depending on the actual population coverage
and the available HR at the selected health facility. States should take these variations in to considerations
while estimating the actual budgetary requirement. E.g., Infrastructure strengthening may vary from Nil to
Rs. 15 Lakh per SHC as per the condition of the building in different contexts.
In addition to these budgetary allocations, the untied funds for SHCs would be Rs. 50,000 per HWC to meet
additional and non- anticipated requirements for delivery of CPHC services.
11.2 Performance Linked Payments
One of the key features of the HWCs is the introduction of performance-linked payments for service providers
following the capitation-based payment models. This has been envisaged to improve the quality of services
delivery by incentivizing providers to ensure better health outcomes for the population in the catchment
area. This shift in payment mechanism, in our context, would also address perceived challenge of poor
performance of the providers in public health facilities.
This would be achieved by linking one proportion of the salary with the performance/service delivery and
providing team based incentives based on improvement in health outcomes.
a. Performance Based Payments: All service providers at HWCs i.e.; Mid- level Health Providers (at
SHC-HWC), Medical Officers and Staff Nurses at PHCs/ UPHCs HWCs can receive 60% of their salary
as a fixed remuneration while remaining 40% the salary may be linked with the performance based
on measurable performance indicators. Suggestive indicators for performance measurement of
MLHP will be shared with the States. Pre- requisite of implementing performance-based payments
AYUSHMAN BHARAT: Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centers

58
is a robust IT system that is able to track the number of individuals (service users) empanelled with
the HWCs, range of services delivered at HWCs and coverage of HWCs and the outputs/ outcomes
achieved.
b. Team Based Performance incentives: HWC teams will be provided annual/periodic monetary
incentives based on the collective performance of the primary health teams in improving health
outcomes of the population covered. This would instil team spirit and provide mechanisms to
influence collective motivation among the team. It would also enable identification of areas of
performance improvement and the need for skill up gradation. Suggestive indicators for team-based
incentives will be shared with the States. In addition to the utilization of the IT system, assessment of
HWC team’s performance would require institutionalizing mechanisms for independent monitoring,
either through partnerships through research organizations, NGOs, SHSRCs and medical colleges or
through training the existing staff at district and block level to undertake these assessments on a
biannual basis.
c. Utilization of other resources: Funds for supporting HWCs could also be leveraged from other
sources such as MP/ MLALAD and Panchayat/ ULB funds. Funds available under Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) may also be tapped to support infrastructure strengthening and service delivery
at HWCs. As part of the convergence, funds available under various programmes like ICDS etc can
also be utilized to support coordinated efforts for improving health outcomes.
